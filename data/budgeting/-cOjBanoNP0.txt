if you're new to budgeting and you don't know where to start in this video I'm going to be sharing how to create a basic monthly budget and stick around to the end because I have a really easy way for you to automate the process hey guys welcome back to the quickin YouTube channel I'm your host Justine I'm a personal finance educator and Enthusiast and I love budgeting in fact it was the number one tool that helped me pay off $35,000 in student loan debt in 2 years 5 months on a $37,000 income now there are really two ways that you can budget you can either budget by paycheck or you can budget by your monthly income there's no right or wrong to which method you choose if you choose to budget by paycheck then you're going to see exactly how that paycheck is broken up for bills that are upcoming in between that paycheck and the next and then what kind of basic spending that you want to be doing in between your next paycheck when we are budgeting by month we're taking a look at all of the bills and the spending inside of that 30-day window and seeing how we can move money around to achieve our goals now I want to hop over to my kitchen table to show you what this looks like on pen and paper so let's go all right to get started with your basic budget what you're going to do is you're going to write down what your monthly or what your paycheck income is this is your actual take-home I like to do things in a monthly budget but you might want to do it by paycheck so in this case I put at $4,000 and then you're going to list out the total monthly expenses which we are going to find out here in just a second as we look at all of our expenses in the month then whatever your income is minus the expenses is going to be your net amount ideally you want to have this be as close to zero as possible this is what we call a zero based budget where every dollar of income is designated to an expense or to savings so as we're taking a look at this example what I did is I started with any existing debt that you might have so this could include a student loan of $230 every single month a car loan of $420 a credit card and right now I'm just putting the minimum amounts for every single debt and then a second credit card of $150 so these are our known debts that we know we absolutely have to pay out of that $4,000 take-home next I'm going into our fixed expenses these are all of the known things that we know we absolutely have to pay for every single month including a mortgage in this case I put a $1,500 monthly mortgage plus any type of food of groceries expenses and so here's where you're going to start filling these out so food would be groceries not restaurant spending restaurant spending would go inside of fun utilities including things like water trash electricity your internet or your cell phone bill and then any car related expenses such as gas car ins Insurance tags registration that sort of thing would go under car expenses these are our fixed expenses if you don't have a car then you would be putting your monthly Transportation such as a Metro ticket or Metro pass the next category after all of your debts and your fixed expenses are covered then any money left over I like to dedicate towards the fund section and then later on into savings so fund could include things like restaurants shopping clothing and entertainment you can keep keep this granular or you can keep this as broad as you want to sometimes people just like to put whatever is left over after their bills and their fixed expenses have been paid into just a lump fun or self-care category towards the bottom you'll want to include things like savings for an emergency fund or a vacation fund or perhaps you want to do something like outside investing and this is where you can start taking shape of your monthly budget as you go through each of these categories want to take note of what those expenses are on a monthly basis by adding them all up and then taking a look at okay Do my expenses actually outweigh what I'm bringing in every single month if so then we've got to make some adjustments to our budget to make sure that we're not overspending if we have a negative amount it means we're overspending if we have a surplus it means that we have cash that we can dedicate to either a financial goal or maybe add some more money to a food budget or a shopping budget so that you can make this as customized to your life as you want to so that's a look at your basic monthly budget and how to put it together if you can just keep it really high level by starting with your monthly income and then working through any existing monthly debt payments your fixed and your fund payments as well as making sure you put in room for your savings this is going to get you started all right so now you've got the basics down if you want to automate your transactions and put together a really robust spending plan because I know doing it on a sheet of paper can
