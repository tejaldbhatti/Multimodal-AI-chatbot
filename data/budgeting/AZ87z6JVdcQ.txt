really good episode with with Jesse we've got four rules for successful budgeting that you are going to that we still will apply to this day yeah let's get into it Jesse welcome to the show thanks for having me I'm excited yes we're so thrilled to talk with you and hear just all of your wisdom and insight about budgeting as we said when we weren't recording yet you have quite a cult following and I cannot tell you we're about two years into this Frugal Friends podcasts and I have had so many people when I tell them about my podcast immediately jump to have you heard of wi hat excellent excellent okay so I have so I've heard of it and so now I'm so thrilled to have you on we are really excited about getting into what you call the four rules for successful budgeting I think that we can't talk enough about budgeting uh when we think we've moved Beyond it we've got to come back and revisit it so so we want to hear from you how you approach it what your ideas are on this and just kind of give us a general layout with what budgeting looks like how to do it successfully so your first one is give every dollar a job can you tell us a little bit more about that yeah the F the first rule is well the other three rules that we'll get to are all kind of derivatives of that rule so this is the rule if there were just one um and essentially what we're trying to do is just introduce the idea of trade offs for people right away out of the gate uh it's something that people are less familiar with doing once they become an adult so kids are really good at trade-offs they're really good at saying like I don't have money for this so I can't buy it but I do want this so I won't buy that other thing but adults we tend to just kind of think we can buy everything um we don't confront the idea of if I do this I maybe can't do that and so a zero based budget which is exactly what rule one is it's just the idea of you know only money you have on hand how much do you want to give toward rent toward uh you know bills toward a vacation whatever it may be but you want to make sure that you recognize that there's a finite amount of money and that you're just prioritizing we we want to be proactive with what our money should do and not reactive in kind of lamenting about what it did um that's that's pretty fruitless so that's that's the idea is introducing tradeoffs and with that that scarcity we actually want you to feel like money has run out because it really has and we want you to get used to the idea of your priorities kind of being fleshed out in an environment where the money is finite so part of rule one is just giving every dollar job just straight up on a piece of paper you don't have to use fancy software just here are all the jobs I want my money to do and then here's how much money I have on hand right now not here's how much I'll earn not all in a couple days not even in tomorrow tomorrow I'm G to be paid but money on hand only and then when new money comes in you just repeat that step again and you you know you start giving that money jobs but don't fall into the Trap of projecting what the money will be because then you're not dealing with find out resources anymore you can you can forecast yourself right out of a scarcity situation so um that's kind of rule one you know we've talked about it for about 15 years but that's it in in two minutes that's awesome it's funny that you say like scarcity and like physical scarcity cuz I feel like we think like scarcity mindset causes us to want to spend everything because we think that you know we won't have enough or we won't get more and so that's how like people start living in this paycheck to paycheck cycle is this scarcity mindset but then when you kind of flip it and you're like causing physical scarcity then it can cause the opposite effect yeah yeah and they're not it's not to be confused with like fixed and growth mindsets or like what Dr Z came up with a while back we're we're talking about addressing finite resources so a lot of people that are living paycheck to paycheck they they're used to not having money but in a weird kind of counterproductive way where when they do have money they want to use it so they so they because it's going to run out anyway and so we might as well kind of make hey well the sun shines and that's that's the issue that we're we're addressing we want people to say okay I have this money what do I want it to do the end and if it if it means that you are you spend it all that day because you have an A pressing bill and it's the only thing you can possibly afford then that is what you do but we we take thousands and thousand thousands of people that have on average about $300 in their checking account when they start and we're not talking about people that are living below the poverty line or out I'm talking about people that make good money that carry around $300 in the checking account on average it goes really high when their paycheck lands and then it just precipitously drops wow and it's because they're they have this pile of bills that's just waiting for money and then as soon as that money comes in the bills just suck it all away and so we try and start to flip that around instead of being reactive we're proactive the amazing thing is someone with just $300 in their checking account if you tell them okay only deal with that $300 what do you want your money to do immediately say well I'm getting I'm actually going to get paid in five days so and you're like no don't do that well in five days we'll do it but we're not talking about that today so what do you want your money to do that $300 and again again without fail they'll try and bring up the paycheck that's coming because they're so used to thinking about when money does come then this problem will go away so we we rean them back in again and then we just say okay thank you for telling me again for the third time about your future paycheck you're getting really want you just to focus on the $300 and so you get them there and it's just it's just the the mind just habitually goes there for them it's they're not like not able to it's just they're in this kind of ingrained process so you get him there with that 300 bucks and you say what does it need to do they'll say uh well my gas tank is a little low um fridge is a little empty and there's this one bill that's actually kind of late already I really need to pay it or I'll start getting late fees so you say boom boom boom okay we're done it's amazing how many people with that still only $300 in their checking account will then say wow that feels really good for once they're actually taking control and they're dictating like a good dictator they're dictating what their money would do instead of just kind of waiting for something to explode on them where they're in panic mode and so it's all about just orienting forward and dealing with that finite pile of cash when the new check comes in same exercise yes we've talked about this concept before of being the CEO of your personal finances and this kind of Falls in line with that of you are giving your dollar bills a job and you need to delegate that and in a lot of ways that does put power and control rightfully so back into our hands rather than being victim to whatever might be happening with my finances yeah people are familiar with that I mean if you're if you've ever tried to lose weight or you know dialing your Fitness or Finance not finances but food a little bit it's the same thing everyone knows if you plan your meals you do better uh if you try and be a little more productive during the day everyone knows that if you plan your day it's it's that same principle that we see all over the place I mean heck plan your career like people that really rise in their career they have a plan they have an idea they aren't just waiting to see what happens with their boss or waiting to see with some job opening that comes up they're proactively strategizing and figuring out okay this is what I'm going to go do this and there this and I should be on this project because it's big they're planning and we're we want to do the same thing with our money we spend all of this time and effort and energy to make money and then for some reason once all that effort is converted into Dollars we suddenly just like oh whatever I'm just bad with money it's it's horrible oh my gosh louder for the people in the back yeah please yes oh my gosh a plan and a strategy for all that time and effort and like most people don't even like their jobs anyway so you're going to do all this stuff and then the fruits your labor come in and then you're not whatever yeah it's like let me get this straight you went to school to get an education to get this job you went into debt to get an education to get that job you work around people that maybe you don't like if you work at weab you'll like our people but you work around people that you don't like um you're doing a job that maybe isn't that fulfilling all of that pain and suffering and then when it's converted into money you're like oh whatever I mean it's just bizarre like oh I have so much debt and a job I don't like I have to treat myself at TJ Maxx yeah I do do like that treat yourself thing from Parks and wreck I can't get enough of that I I say that a lot you know it happens one day I mean if you plan for it have a treat yourself category and you just fill that up absolutely the budgeting is give that dollar a job the job is to do that and that's perfectly okay we we actually tried really really hard really hard not to try and tell people what their money should do we just say decide and we just repeat that over and over just decide well I want to do this should I do that I think I spent too much on these shoes or this golf club or name your or a tool whatever name your thing like we have so many stereotypical like oh my gosh they wasted money it's like it doesn't matter as long as you're being intentional about what you love I mean go for it I'll never step into a Hobby Lobby and buy anything but it doesn't it or or Target for Target actually is a really popular one because in our Facebook group it's you mention Target and people are like oh yeah you know throw pillows like you mentioned throw pillows and people are like yeah yeah the throw pillow situation but even then you have to just be like hey if if you're doing some kind of retail therapy like name the category retail therapy like call it out and be like yeah I therap I do therapy with shopping okay at least you're calling it out and you know not not hiding from it um but just be intentional with it it's it works works really well be be aware of what you're doing with your spending that's that's first and then you can budget and if you don't like what you're doing with your spending then you can refine your budget to be how you want it to be AB yeah I mean just the other day I was sitting there eating ice cream from like a Ben and Jerry's and Julie's like what are you doing I'm like I'm just eating my feelings she's like yeah okay I mean that's basically what it is you know I had a long day work I'm stressed I'm just GNA eat my feelings yeah at least at least you're calling it what it is you know let's not pretend yes yeah oh my gosh I ate a spoonful of cookie dough last night you know in case we're confessing there it is I think that's the latter part of the podcast confessions not there yet okay thanks Jesse keeping us on track well then let's let's move on speaking about expenses the second rule is to embrace your true expenses what's all that about so if rule one is to take a finite pile of money and give every dollar a job kind of like we're in the present moment only and we're just dealing with like current fires even rule two is to look ahead to less fre expenses that are coming up and break those up into manageable monthly amounts so we talk about embracing your true expenses it kind of means like get real about the idea that all of your expenses aren't these nice little tidy paycheck cycle timed things that land so if you have um I don't know Christmas coming up like Christmas does land every year like same day like it's never changed and people are like oh my gosh that just really snuck up on me well use that as an example so were at the time of this recording a couple months out right if you said you wanted to spend $600 on Christmas and we have October November December to get there I would say well you need to set aside $200 for this month 200 for the next 200 for the next you're just making little syncing funds for all kinds of large less frequent expenses that normally surprise you a lot of people make good money make plenty of money and they look at only their monthly bills that come in nice tidy little envelopes and they say I don't know why I'm not getting ahead I clear make more than my monthly bills but then they don't think about the car tires that are going to blow out in four months the HVAC unit that'll die three days after the warranty expires the roof will need repairs the the dishwasher doesn't work that well like it just goes on and on like there's this in accounting they call it depreciation where you know the asset value declines over time and that is how life works that is how cars work that's how houses work that's how so many things work things just wear out and so all we're saying is we recognize that car tires do do not last forever and so we're going to set aside a little bit of money for the car if you drive a 2002 Honda Civic I can tell you it's like a hundred bucks a month that'll keep you pretty steady right and you're just paying those bills as you go every month now you're not actually paying them because those piles of money are building up over time but the really cool thing about this is then you have a person that's going back to rule one and they're saying I'm going to give every dollar a job and now they're debating like should I go to sushi or should I go to Little Caesars in light of the fact that their car tire will blow out and they don't know when it will go but they do know that they don't last forever so they're like ah should I go to sushi or Little Caesars I'm also paying for car tires for the future and then they may be elect to go to Little Caesars or might be better just not to go anywhere you know might be better to eat no KN against Little Caesar but it is gross I mean like I don't want to say anything bad about it but you could eat the box and You' be like am I is this the Pizza did I get all right it had cheese on it so so that's that's the call right you're they're they're saying like it's kind of like future version of Jen walks back and is like hey current Jen like just so you know like I'm gonna be on the side of a road and I'm gonna have to call a tow truck and you better not leave me high and dry and Jen's like okay I I'll have the Little Caesars that's cool like that's the negotiation that you're doing with yourself or you know if you're sharing finances you're doing it with each other there's like four people at the table if you're with your partner it's like current you guys and then future you guys and future you guys are like we're going to go on an anniversary trip and you're like you are yes we are and you better fund that thing because we don't want to go there we don't want to put it on a card we don't want to live chiny we want to live high for a couple days and we want to do it without having to worry about our money and so the current versions of you are like okay yeah that sounds pretty good so we'll we'll make a few adjustments here you know that's future so wise AI might be the most important new computer technology ever it's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested so buckle up the problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power so how do you compete without cost spiraling out of control it's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud Oracle Cloud infrastructure or oci oci is a single platform for your infrastructure database application development and AI needs oci has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds offers one consistent price instead of

hilarious world of sibling connections on sibling revry with Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson you might be asking yourself what is sibling rry yeah well we just made it up they'll have some laughs and maybe Inspire some people along the way with universal Tales of what it's like to grow up with brothers and sisters we're full blood siblings the only full blood sibling in our family well not in the world I mean no in the whole world that's just it like no one dive into family tales and explore the human mind with guests like Joel and Benji Madden and it's fun because we've decided to open it up you know to really like all kinds of different siblings and it's going to be a an awesome season it's more than a podcast it's a celebration of the ties that bind us listen to Sibling revry with Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson on the iHeart Radio app app podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts so wise future Jan's uh intent maybe I'm not the wisest because I'm on the side of the road but yeah I think though Jesse you're identifying what can cause so many people to feel like they cannot get ahead in their budget or in their finances you know we we might even know how to create a budget but it only includes my my food my shelter and my bills and not thinking about those other unexpected expenses that that are what can keep us at a certain level and not able to move Beyond so whether or not we do make a decent amount of money and I would say this is especially an issue for those who don't make a lot of money and we we've got a lot of listeners like that I've been there uh at various points in life so I think even having our sites on this when we don't bring in a lot of cash every month is a really helpful muscle to begin building of okay I know that there's going to be some sort of emergency situation where future me is really mad at the current me for not thinking about this um and being able to be more intentional and planful for those things can help us cross that barrier from um stay being stuck really where we don't want to be absolutely and most people um most people they've run out of real money and they have an emergency and they they have to go to a card and and put it on a bill and it's always like when the when the month is normal I'll be able to pay that bill off when things kind of normalize when things settle down I mean here I am talking about that in 2020 it's like what a joke but the the idea of things kind of settling down and normalizing there is no such thing as a normal month you could go back to your credit card statement that you may be paying full and you're super responsible about it or whatever or you can go to your bank account and you just can scan down the call column really old school like and just look for a digit to pop out that makes the number a little bigger and find those and be like was that normal and without fail every month you'll be like oh yeah we had that so- and so's birthday I had to grab him a gift that I'd forgotten about or oh it was this every month is abnormal and people just slowly tack on the debt because they have that little emergency that little onetime thing it's very rarely a massive medical emergency or something where you're like this this is clear it's it's these Death By A Thousand Cuts what's really cool about it is people will make the right Smart Financial decision when they're presented with those trade-offs to go back to rule one it's like do you want to be ready for car repair or do you want to uh I'll say blow it or do you want to blow it on this or that impulse thing nobody says I'm gonna blow it once presented correctly with that information in context people are smart with their money when they're given that decision at the right time with the right context and the right implications tox along with it yeah I love I I love that and I know I used to get really overwhelmed with the idea of multiple syncing funds like for saving for multiple things yeah so if somebody listening is like me this is what I did to kind of help me wrap my brain around it I needed to go with just one single syncing Fund in a separate account so I have like three checking counts I have the regular one I spend out of I have my emergency fund and then I have my sying fund account and it's like I have a list of things that I'm going to need in the future so like we know our AC and our water heater is going to blow in the next few years um and we just replaced some windows that were really like bringing down or raising our electricity costs M so we just we calculated the cost of each of those and saved that amount um for each in the syncing fund and so when it came time we chose or you know we chose to do the windows you know before the other things broke and so we just took that money out of one account but like say my tires blow and I didn't pay for those I'd already have that money in the syncing fund I can still just take out of there and then just fund it with that cost later I still have the money it's it's like allocated and it it just makes more sense for me because it's not like I don't feel like I'm taking from the water heater fund to pay for the tires I'm just taking for the future protection fund as it would be um and so I don't feel as like overwhelmed by having a lot of different syncing funds yeah I mean that we I mean people use spreadsheets to track that in our software we that's the software is built to basically have all of your money in one account and you never look at the account balance it's not even a thing for you so you just are looking at your HVAC category worry and you can be more or less granular depending on how much you care about these things so I don't you know I don't think you should save up for the next tube of toothpaste but I but there are like large material things where you could say okay this makes sense so in your instance if you had all these different syncing funds in wab it would look like a long list of categories each with a goal amount attached like I'm G to fund it $672 every month well you just set up that up one time and then you're kind of just clicking and on autopilot if you do ever have to move money around which happens that's our third rule to roll with the punches when new information comes up then you're you're just still planning you're just still going back to rule one and you're saying you know what the car tire went out a little quicker than we thought so we're going to move it from here we'll catch up you know we we we'll be fine and so it is kind of this overall future protection fund I don't like the idea of just a savings fund like No Labels because that tends to be a little bit of a revolving door so people are like I've got to save ever I just actually heard on a podcast I've got to save so I'm going to save and they're feeling really good and then they raid the savings account six weeks later and then they're feeling really bad and and so you want to put a job to that money to make sure that you're clear what it is for that way when you do go in and grab it you don't feel guilty because you did need to buy a new computer or whatever but you can also be clear like all right here here's why like we have we have some intention attached to this and you can keep it all in one account like you do you can keep it I mean heck I we keep everything in in one checking account it's just like it's the most boring I mean every time you go to the bank well I mean not that we go to the bank very often but would be so alarmed by the size of our account balance it's because we're saving for a car in there we're saving for house repairs we're saving for Christmas and after a while thousands and thousands of dollars start to pile up and the person at the bank's like what are you what are you doing and you're like I'm what are you doing that's you know that's what you would say to the why is this shocking to you Nancy so don't give me that dirty look and no I don't want bill pay or overdraft protection so this is why I do everything online but that I like like the idea of assigning that uh those savings accounts real jobs so that there's some there's some specificity there what's weird is most weabers start to not need that third thing you mentioned that emergency fund that kind of just general just in case they find that they use it not that I advise against it but like a three-month deal is probably fine they find that they've started to anticipate what used to be emergencies like a car tible on out it's not an emergency because they're not infinitely useful so it's just part of living you know like someone said I had to go to the doctor that was an emergency he like well no you're alive so come on you know yeah that we knew that was coming um but then there the catastrophic massive you know this meets our insurance deductible type emergencies yeah that's that's where they come into play I I totally agree with you a lot of people are saying things that are emergencies but it's like you could have anticipated that for at least a few months ago yeah like oh my gosh like the baby came and you're like I'm no I'm no OBGYN but I think I know 40 weeks is usually standard so yeah you had to have noticed mons ago something was happening down there yeah yeah we don't it was months was never a thing for us it was weeks it was like and I was I wasn't allowed to be like hey Julie aren't you like week 22 she's like no I'm week 21 in three days I'm like oh sorry I was not allowed to round up I'm not allowed to round up on that and I'm not allowed to round up on the baby's age so if Brooks our new one if he's you know like five months and 25 days I can't be like oh he's six months old she's like no he's not he's five months old it's so important they're those you don't want to age him too quick yeah their development milestones are so diverse yeah she's like no he's not he's developing just fine okay people think he's behind what a good example of you rolling with the punches oh I I'm I'm bringing us back don't worry I like I didn't know so many things about all these things so I'm learning yeah that's amazing I'm learning too number three on on your rules is to roll with the punches uh can you can you tell us about that who's punching you life yeah yeah if you're alive if you're alive you know like we we getting a little bit of sport I don't know how Sports oriented your group is but I think everyone can understand this like you if you were to watch um Let's do let's do basketball you have like the coach reviews game film becomes a master at that opponent does all of this leg work the team is like like they're pretending to be the other opponent they're mimicking it they're scrimmaging they're doing all this prep work and that's like your budget you're thinking about it you're like okay what would you hear what would you hear and it's this perfectly LED plan as soon as the game starts if if they're a good coach then they're like oh well let's change that a little bit we thought they would use this guy I don't even know you know we thought they do this more no you're deep in it now keep going it's like they over or or chess let's do chess it's probably it's probably more our speed I guess similar simar they're like they they make a play like everyone goes in with a plan and then you see how your opponent reacts and you're like all right I'll do it a little different that that's budgeting so for some reason people they'll set their budget and then they're like oh also I I've started budgeting and I predict the future like that's kind of what they've decided as their thing and they're like they're Clairvoyant you there's a really horrible movie with with Sandra bulock called premonition I think horrible movie but it's this idea she like see the future then okay now you've got it or even worse Nicholas Cage with another horrible movie called Next horrible movie oh good let's talk about all those I I recommend that one because it is so bad it's actually enjoyable but the idea that you could see into the future and then you have this firm plan nobody can do that and so you have a beginning budgeter that's never gotten their their head wrapped around any of this and suddenly their condition for for saying like good job you is so astronomically high this level of perfection is so high it it blows my mind and so what I'm trying to say is okay you'll set your plan for the next three days and then as soon as something new pops up we're just going to change the plan and so all rule three is and I can't even believe we have to make it a a rule but the rule is change your plan as needed okay like if you're going on vacation soon if you're so lucky right and you've planned to have go to some Sunny place and then it rains does that mean you you say now vacations don't work I mean that would like but that's what people do with budgeting they're like oh budgeting doesn't work I knew this wouldn't work you know I listen to that one dumb guy on that one podcast and he was wrong and it's unfortunate because what we're really trying to do is say hey you made a plan just adjust as you go budgeting is not a thing it is a process so rule three is just going back to rule one and saying hey given the new information you have you want to maybe give every dollar a job slightly differently than you did before and you're still winning you're like this is you being successful this is you doing it perfectly if you need me to say that recognizing that the future is not static how often would you say or how much of a pulse would you recommend somebody have on their budget daily when they're first starting daily yeah as uh as your skill level is low meaning you don't have this habit you haven't done like the whole Atomic habits James Clear thing or whatever and so you're like okay I have no skill or low skill here that means you need a high frequency of interaction with the budget the other side of it is if you uh don't make a lot where you don't have a lot of that wiggle room some people can like they just make more money so things just don't affect them as much if you are one of those people that make a lot less that also means you should be in the budget more because there's there's just less wiggle room less room for air the other one is if you're on a highly volatile income you should be looking at it more often because there is more room for air there so those three things this is brand new to you be in it daily make it like a part of your coffee thing right sip your coffee swipe through your budget stare at it see what happens that works if you're um tight if money's tight look at it more often and if money is really volatile you know like you're I don't know you're commission based something or other look at it more often yeah selfemployed the last rule that you have is AG your money and I feel like this is the most unique and interesting Rule and I would love to hear the story behind it so it's not a good story I mean it's not interesting is what I mean to say so I I when Julie and I were first married we were we were students we were super young and super poor and we were watching our money really closely and I built this little spreadsheet that eventually became the weab software and all that but at the time it was just she and I just doing our thing and we were on hourly pay working as students and our hours would fluctuate and I didn't like going back to rule one and knowing how much we had to budget I didn't like not knowing because my hours could be 25 or 35 and hers would be varied and so I just had this idea I took some money from our wedding money that we had actually been given I took some money from there I said let's live off of this money and then we'll work for a month and we'll have money in in our hands now for the next month and Julie because we were in our honeymoon phase she was just like cool like I could do anything wrong at that point so she's like yeah that's fine you are brilliant and goodlooking and that is a good idea you know so so that's that's what we landed on so it was really just for me I was a little bit of a money hack to be like I don't want to be waiting to see what I will earn in order to be able to budget I just want to know what I already have and budget money I'd earned a while ago and so that turned into about 30 days and then as we talked people people are like this instead of having a pile of bills waiting for money to arrive it was flipped around they had this pile of money and then when a bill would come people were like this is awesome I'll just pay it and then you start putting stuff on autopay and it's and then you've gotten out of that game there's a there's a total game that everyone plays this huge game with all kinds of rules and orchestrations where uh timing their bills to their paychecks and doing this like song and dance and like sticky notes in places and and just like what about this and then you're sharing money with a partner it's like well did you spend that there oh that was for this bill it's this weird song and dance and it it adds no value I mean if you think about the value of paying your electricity bill it's just that the electricity stays on but anything extra beyond the payment of the bill is just wasted effort and so you think about all the effort people put into that song and dance so we get rid of all of that then when a bill comes it's just paid and then suddenly people are like my finances the best thing they ever say is they'll write in and they'll say my finances are super boring nothing exciting ever happens like everything just kind of seems pretty ho hum and you're like you've arrived like you have arrived life yeah life is still like coming at you with all kinds of things but your money kind of like normalizes it and you're not living right on the edge so when we talk about aging your money we're really saying if you earned a dollar yesterday that's like a baby dollar and you don't send babies out into the world you know you protect them you keep them close for a little while when they're ready you let them go and when they're too old you like you kick them out right to be clear get out get out but at first you don't do that and that's what we want with our dollars we want to have them like hang out for a while 30 to 60 days the cool thing about this is you get to a point where you're staring at let's say the beginning of November and you're like I have all of the money I would need for November including funding those sinking funds from rule two like you're fully flushed out and then you're like okay yeah it's all here and then you work in November you earn that money it refills and then you're staring at December and you're like we're ready to roll and we have money for Christmas unless you finish Christmas shopping like in October which makes you kind of weird but people do that so that the idea of living ahead instead of behind that paycheck to paycheck stress cycle is so bad we were talking about sleeping I think before we record maybe I mean like it literally steals sleep from you it literally strains relationships where some benign comment from a spouse or partner about money suddenly becomes this big deal only because you're artificially stressed not because it actually is a big deal so there's so much there that you can get away from if you just live 30 to 60 days the dollar you're spending you earned 30 days ago 40 days ago it's it's wonderful now to get there just follow the first three rules it will happen over time there's no magic there there's you just follow them it takes people on average about six months to get there um with not doing anything extraordinary Beyond just being really intentional and cutting expenses where they realize they didn't like them and uh yeah just working the system I like the example that you gave of how you did this when you were young married uh still respected and and because I think that we can often talk about budgeting and and how you can have all these different funds and savings and and it's just this thing and we can get it to work out so well and then we have people who are not making a lot of money and and this can feel really overwhelming or maybe even depleting to be like I that's not my reality but to hear your example of how you did this even when you weren't making a lot even when you were hourly part-time I mean of course it had something to do with gifts that had been received but there are other ways of going about that I mean input side hustle uh living living in an environment well below what what you're bringing in whether that means needing to move so that your living expenses are less right there's some ways of getting creative but I think that I just want to highlight what you mentioned there that this is possible even if you're not making six figures and some of these Concepts and the frame work of it we can put into place regardless of where we may find ourselves currently in our current Financial circumstances of course the goal is always how can we bring in more so that we're not stuck in that place every one of these rules I came up with at my poorest and I say poor meaning financially so I had um I had all kinds of of family structure and support that I'm I'm while we forever grateful for that you can't even price tag at all um but we we lived in an apartment that cost $350 a month and we we and so that was 80 years that was that was a long time ago yeah I I age well actually but uh it was yeah it was early 2000 and it was a junky I mean it was a horrible apartment so we could have spent more or I mean we could have lived somewhere else that was more expensive but um the we had respiratory issues while we lived there like I think there was stuff in the walls it was it was it was bad but we lived there for a year we didn't have phones we didn't um uh we didn't own a car for the first little while we didn't own a computer for the first little while I would use computers on campus well mean we were simple students in the sense that we had like one objective like we got to get through school um and you know we were making Julie was making 11 bucks an hour I was making I think 1050 or something she was full-time at the end uh working in social work where you don't they don't pay you so she's full-time making $111 an hour and we we were like okay we can make this work we actually saved money um and that but we lived cheap Little Caesars was a big deal back then you know and maybe that's why I PTSD yeah so but like once a month we're like oh sweet we get that $5 hotton ready and it was awesome it's so those rules they they aren't this like pick and choose because your situation is tied I would say no no no those rules came about and were used to great effect in my situation that was the Titus now I make more money thankfully I feed way more people not you know not necessarily thankfully a lot more bills all of that all of that is so much more expensive but the rules still are working it's just it's about being super intentional and like we went back all that effort you put into earning money that 11 bucks an hour that Julie was working toward we're g to waste that when you know she's having to go to this place she doesn't really like to make a pittance we're when we're supposed to waste it then I don't think so no way quite the opposite right so it it works at every income level yeah well said you know what else works and we never get tired of it at every income level the bill of the week that's right it's time for the best minute of your entire week maybe a baby was born and his name is William maybe you paid off your morgage maybe your car died and you're happy to not have to pay that bill anymore duck Bills Buffalo Bills Bill Clinton this is the Bill of the week Jesse every week we have a listener or guests submit their bill of the week for us to share um it is your turn do you have a bill for us I was going to use watching the trailer of the sequel of Bill and teds I was like that that could work but yes I only watched the trailer and I thought that's about enough of that but um my my favorite bill that has just started becoming my favorite is my electricity bill so I got it a week two weeks ago it was $16.42 and that's not too shabby no especially in the sum like three hot ready yeah yeah three pizzas everything is in pizzas at our house as far as currency as it should be yeah that's how I budget yeah so it was the first my first bill that I received after I had paid a whole lot of money for a fancy solar system so it was and it was not for financial reasons like oh this makes sense I just really liked the idea of the solar and like so many other parts of it appealed to me besides the long pay back period so I didn't Finance it or anything I saved up for it I got all those P panels on and then I became obsessed with our power consumption at that point so I can tell you like our base house rate is6 kilowatts an hour like it just does that if the oven's on I know that if like it's gotten better but Julie was like is this GNA be a thing now forever where you're on your phone and being like what what is calling Julie what are you doing what are you doing over there is there oh you're baking bread I apologize and that is that's totally okay blow drying your hair that would yeah so it was it was super funny but yeah that's my favorite bill it's been fun to see like this magic uh and I'm I'm not like even a big environmentalist or like but it was it did feel like magic it was like oh my gosh the sun you know who would have thought this is what you can look forward to when your budget becomes boring you get super into electricity consumption really wow Jesse thank you yeah if your life has become all about your energy consumption and you want to tell us about it please visit Frugal Friends podcast.com Bill and leave us your

podcasts M now it's time for the light round we try not to yell so much I want to plug the counselor thing because I I went to a counselor for like five years um it was awesome yes and like it people are like there there's a stigma I think it's going away but man I I started going to see her and suddenly it was like my back pain went away weird and I just I was so nice to be able to just like unload on someone who's just kind of like cool cool cool cool did you know this and you're like no I didn't you know it was awesome yes that's that's how they do it yeah highly recommend it it's for like it's I I think it makes you I don't know if if you're like this like I don't know go hard like money hungry performances everything even then you're like you should go see a therapist like they will bring you your like they will up your game wherever you're at like you'll you'll see it increased so anyway I didn't mean to extend the you're good I'm a counselor myself I can't say enough about it them little thanks Jesse for sharing yeah it's always good to just continue to chip away at the stigma that can surround seeking help and knowing that there there is help out there that can be affordable and can help us we're whole people I mean I know that we F really focus in on finances but it does affect us physically and relationally and emotionally and financially so yeah I can't say enough good things about caring for our whole person perfect absolutely all right so in this lightning round we are going to get into our latest budgeting flubs and how we recovered from them so Jesse as our guest we'll allow you to go first because yours will probably be the shortest I was I was hoping I could go last to kind of get a read of the room a little bit to figure out what kind of a flub we're looking for so um that's why you're going first yeah uh I've I've taken over the Costco Run for the the family because like the baby came so he's kind of a priority and um so I'm like I'll do the Costco run so Tuesday is my day and I this is embarrassing but um I didn't know how much we had spent when when I walked out and then came home and Julie was like what was the she goes man you got a lot and I was like now to be clear like I do her list like she we have a synced up note you know on our phone and I'm like update the note she gets it all updated and then it's just like this long and it's it's nerve-wracking because she might say something like chicken and I'm like organic boneless skinless organic tender loines like what are we doing here you know so we're working on we're working on like full communication like how how is this you know she's like I really wanted this kind and she's a phenomenal cook which means her standard of like what she wants is is up there so I'm already nervous and then she's like well how much was it and I had I couldn't even tell her I'm like I did not notice the cost I one of those zone out moments yeah I was like I was at Costco but was I was I there like the guy's like here's your card I'm like oh okay and I didn't even like it's that was that that was yesterday so I'm giving you a re like there's some recency bi us there but I was pretty bothered by the fact that like I just dropped and I'm telling you like at our family size we have seven kids with two like some teenagers in there that eat like three people's worth each and so we're not talking about like oh he's spent $90 and didn't realize it I only wish I can't get out of there for less than 200 like no no no no no no one can get out of Costco under I'll just go in and get some milk it's like no you won't you get you'll get you walk out with like a flat screen TV on one shoulder and then like milk on the other side you know yeah and socks and underwear for cost is your target man I'm like do you guys have throw pillows here cuz any no but we do have swing sets yeah and there were uh like Christmas full full board Christmas going on at like I mean full on I'm like oh okay well if we didn't have a reminder already through our budget and funding it monthly everybody we would have it if we went to Costco yeah anyway yeah I didn't even realize it so I I'm embarrassed by that I I don't know you'll listen to the cashier a little bit more closely now that is your total comes to so that you can be aware of the spending just a little earlier a little I mean live you're supposed to put it on your phone we have the app you're supposed to put it on your phone record it in the moment it knows you're at Costco and it's like hey cool Costco normally groceries right like it does all this fancy stuff I was totally spaced out I think yeah anyway that was a flub well Jesse you're gonna look great next to me uh I was your your number one rule was resonating with me a lot and when you were talking about children are good at this children are good at recognizing if you can't have this then you can have this um yeah so I just bought a house well not just me my husband and I we together collectively uh bought a house and I have had in my mind I I just haven't really thought about it a ton I mean we did set a lot of money aside I mean first of all I mean just buying a house is expensive beyond the down payment but then also set some more money aside knowing that we want to do some Renovations but I didn't fully think through how much each renovation that I wanted do is going to cost and the timing of it and I'm just kind of having in my head like I want to do it all I want to do it all right now and that's just not the reality I'm learning when you own a house we used to live in a camper and I kind of could have it all it's like yeah everything costs $10 done the whole thing's renovated um and so I am slowly coming to grips with the fact that I got new ceiling fans and I will probably not be able to have a kitchen for a couple of years this kitchen is a dumpster Fire by the way it is functional so how I'm how I'm coping SL recovering with that is really an adjustment in my perspective of okay I'm not going to take out a loan for these Renovations we do want to cash flow them so I recognize that that's like a little bit next level but it's where we're at as Frugal Friends over here so I am learning what I can do to make it a little bit more livable at where we're at right now for very minimal cost until we can get to the point of actually paying for these bigger Renovations out of pocket so luckily it has not thrown me into debt but it is one of those kind of wakeup calls of oh I can't do it all at once and if I do this one thing then that takes this other thing out of the mix so we might just have to get mini splits instead of a new kitchen next and you know I'll paint the walls and be happy with it I like it yeah no no dead on kitchen Renos no way mm yes no even dumpster fires one thing at a time even on dump tell you it is it should it needs to be set on fire so we threw out a lot of it already a lot of it is in the dumpster uh the rest of it is on fire yeah it's so ugly it wouldn't light on fire if you tried so all right well that's all we have today Jen's perfect I'm fine um no so Travis has been off of work for the last couple weeks um he's uh works in the airline industry as a mechanic and so they gave him a voluntary leave several times this year he's in literally his third month off um this year and uh he's taking half pay and I am in my slow season in my business so I have like my income is natural es and flows and and I'm in a natural like I don't know what the E and what the flow is but I'm in the lower one yeah but you're ebing eing right now I I didn't change our budget to reflect that I kept it as it was and then I realized oh that's not our income you you got to roll with that and which we have the money that it's like not affecting us this month um but next month it will um so I didn't uh I didn't cut my expenses in half or you know cut them like I should have uh I just totally went straight over my head then how are you recovering yeah what's the first that's going to go on the expenses um I probably Kai probably he's probably Kai's her son okay I was like Kai he's expensive um it's the new type of soy yeah um I think so I mean we haven't made November's budget yet but um I think we're just going to probably not eat out um probably just you know living on Bare Bones stuff stuff just for one month I'm in a sugar detox right now so I can't think about that I can't think about November right now my mind is here Sugar Detox and not eating out is probably a good combo if you were to do it right I'm not eating out right now anyway yeah so it's not that bad when we ask people how they paid off debt or how they got ahead and we never prescribe like you shouldn't eat out we never say that but um everyone without fail without exception they will say they cut eating out to free up money so it usually is yeah yeah yeah it's not maybe the largest sum of money but it's it can save you a whole lot more than just cutting out buying coffee yeah um it it can eat up a good chunk of that monthly budget yeah we it's not large but we call it squishy it's a squishy category like there's some room there I like that and it makes it sound gross it kind of makes me feel weird though you're like oh eating out it's like why don't you just call it squishy categ and see how appetizing that see how often you do squishy squished and a followup spells will turn the lights off for a whole month see how that goes conserve energy Jesse thanks so much for coming on the show to talk with us about budgets where can people find more about you what's up next for y naab what do you want to say uh people can find us at you need a budget.com so we're there always the best thing to do if I were to recommend one thing uh for people it would be to take one of our 20 minute workshops they're they're fast they're live you can ask questions they're not recorded there there's a real teacher there you can test them and say like say this random word they'll say it like it's live we we've had that happen and um they just they succinctly tell you like okay Jesse's four rules that you heard on this in kind of a really long winded way they'll tell it to you very succinctly and then they'll show you in the software how that's implemented and so it's kind of like Theory and then practice in 20 minutes and it is just well worth the time it's a little bit of a different way to think about money and so we want to get that learning happening fast but do do the workshop they're free you know you don't have to sign up or do anything like that you just go in and and jump on and they run I think we run about 150 a week so like there's one that'll hit your schedule you know wow so all right that's great sweet well thanks so much for coming on Jesse and uh we will hope to see you sometime when people are seeing each other again yeah but this was this was quite nice just this remote video yes thing is as good as it can get right now didn't have to smell each other's coffee breath true good okay well thanks for having me I appreciate it thanks [Music] Jesse well Jill oh tell us about that kitchen oh my this was so fun and alarming to alarming it's like going back through a journal to listen to these episodes that was it was literally almost 2 years ago mhm and listen I wasn't wrong I still don't have a kitchen and now you really don't have a kitchen like it is it is w off behind plastic it it is non-existent right now still enjoying those ceiling fans that I was able to acquire early on and still no kitchen we have demoed so it's not so much a dumpster fire kitchen as it is just not a kitchen at all there is nothing there except for studs not the good kind well they are the good kind they support the house but yeah the kind you want right now yes if I had to choose between studs and studs I'd go with studs Jen it's so I I mean just to have it right in my face the you know disappointment that I experienced two years ago of knowing that it was going to take years and here I am two years later saying Yeah it's you're you're still not that close to having a kitchen yeah but we have continued the cash flow we have not taken out any loan which might be partially why I I don't have a kitchen at all but we have made progress I have a makeshift Kitchen in my laundry room the laundry room is completely renovated and that is pretty beautiful and it's a pretty functional makeshift kitchen it's almost too makeshift because then it prolongs the amount of time it takes to get the kitchen done but oh nevertheless stay tuned for two more years from now and hopefully hopefully by then I'm telling you hopefully you're done yeah it's done I'm cooking in it cooking with gas all those at home meals not eating out because of the squishy budget yeah what about you Jen what's your update I mean we are still ebbing and flowing I guess you still on your sugar detox I laughed when I heard that I laughed but no I mean now we are also in a renovation but we had a a bulk of savings already to do that with so we're still dipping into that and that also could take us several years I would cry but I you know at least the the rental portion please please Lord no so yeah that's um that's about it yeah so I mean take it from me if you're living in it and your cash flowing in it is going to take triple or quadruple the amount of time you would hope yeah and I still I mean my my work income as an entrepreneur still es and flows and so it is that is that's entrepreneur life yeah it's it's gotten a lot better with iHeart the partnership there that has been a big big weight off my shoulders so our our updates sound depressing I am very happy with life so glad I got the house yeah things are great it's just we were I guess we were in like a low Point well no this was 2020 this was a low point for everyone when we originally recorded this yeah so just now the the updates seem low but I mean we're two years happier but uh so thank you for listening to our sad updates but but what brings us a lot of joy is our private Community where we do monthly challenges um and a lot of you are in it um we also offer accountability groups in there so we want to congratulate one of our members for a big mindset shift they had during last month's mindset Challenge and it's Sam W uh she says I'm not a morning person I used to beat myself up over my inability to do focused work before noon but now I just lean into it I spend my mornings doing tasks and chores that force me to move around then settle in for deep work sessions in the afternoon learning this about myself has made me so much more productive so congrats Sam I loved reading this and I resonated it with it so much that we do put a hierarchy around who gets up earliest as if somehow better than those who stay up later and find what works for them so I'm just so glad for that perspective mindset shift for you Sam well done absolutely so thank you for listening if you want to check out our monthly challenge Community head to Frugal Friends podcast.com Club
