hello and welcome to choosefi today on the show we have Tiffany the budget nista aliche is back for her third appearance and she's one of my absolute favorite guest we have just an blast when she comes on she is absolutely infectious with her energy and her knowledge and her thirst to teach she was a preschool teacher and it's just obvious that her community thrives because of her ability to teach and she's back with a new workbook called made whole the Practical guide to reaching your financial goals and this is a companion to her book get good with money which is actually what we talked about on episode 310 the last time she was on and this is a really in-depth granular look at how can I put together a financial life and I think she just did an absolutely marvelous job with that and with that welcome to choose [Music] havei Tiffany my friend it is so good to see you thanks for coming back on honestly Brad it's awesome to be back yeah this should be fun so the book comes out November 21st yes 2023 I know you are in the swing of things right now so thanks for making it back here no thanks for having me honestly chosei is one of my favorite Financial podcasts I love I feel like there can never be enough podcasts to talk about money so I'm glad to be here yeah no I totally hear you so okay for longtime listen listeners for longtime listeners we're not going to go back over your story because people can go to episode 240 and 310 and I highly suggest that they do because those are wonderful episodes I just relistened to them in the last 24 hours so the one thing that I have to bring back up is Jake the thief yes is he still in jail he is he is that's what happens when you defraud the federal government and me nice more importantly you but oh that's amazing that's absolutely amazing so yeah that was my burning question so that's yeah that's a throwback but I guess let's start with the book let's get right into it because there is so much here there's no way we could possibly cover it all but the made whole mindset and I pulled out a quote which I think really encapsulates this is think of financial wholeness as a destination a place to set your sights on and focus your energy toward talk to me about that because I think people get a little overwhelmed and lost when it comes to their personal finances and I think this is a great North Star so when I came up with the concept of financial wholeness it was because as you mentioned I was a teacher for over 10 years like in the classroom and one of the things I learned as a teacher is that basically you teach to the 80% there are 10% of kids that are going to be gifted and fly by everything you teach them and 10% of kids that are going to be challenged and have a hard time but 80% of kids are you know there'll be some Challenge and some ease and so it's really this is the mass that you want to move forward and I thought in the financial space that what I saw more often than not people were teaching to the 10% gifted like oh I don't need you know I have all the the money and the time and the access or the 10% like really really challenged and I thought well what happens especially to this like 80% like why is this component of the population who if just given a little bit of financial knowledge could really Excel and so I came up with these 10 steps to financial wholeness which to me Financial wholeness is when these 10 components are working together to create the life that you desire you don't have to be a millionaire you know this is for the mechanic the teacher the nurse but also to potentially for the doctor the attorney the CEO but also to the new college students but for the most part I wanted a system that could help most people and so that's what Financial wholeness is it's a 10-step system where most people can achieve their financial goals by achieving those 10 steps yeah I love that Focus on the 80% because I think it often is loss right I think you're absolutely right in that yeah it's easy to teach to that top 10% of gifted if you will right the people who just get it right the people who save 70% of their income and hey it's on easy street it's pre-ordained they're going to be millionaires or the people who are in hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and any little shred can help them remarkably but what about everybody else what like you said and what about the people who are just kind of and I say this and it sounds like a pejorative but like going along to getting along like that's how I think of it in my head it's just like the people who are living just regular lives regular middle- class lives no matter how you define that and like they just a couple of steps can put them to you don't have to stress right yes and so those 10 steps so the first five are the foundational and the second five really you build on the foundation so the first five are mastering your budget savings credit debt and learning to earn so those are the first five those are your foundational Financial holess points like you want to work on those first and then once you get really good at those then you can start to learn to invest for both retirement and wealth start leaning into like what does Insurance look like for your life start leaning into building your your financial team net worth and estate planning so that's like the the next level so it doesn't mean you don't work on kind of like Foundation Plus at the same time as working on Foundation but if you don't have a budget a savings plan you know you don't have a Debt Pay Down plan if you have not really worked on your credit or you're not earning anything it's gonna be very difficult to move on to the next level I like that a lot it's funny in reading the book for some reason I did not split it in my own head like that but seeing it and you talking through it it's it's obvious but I don't know why it wasn't obvious to me no I love that that's a good to me a really good teacher you shouldn't feel the effects of the lesson plan it should just feel like you know when I used to teach preschool and the kids would play so they're playing in the house area but they don't know this is a history lesson or this is a social studies lesson so I love that you said that because it should just feel like oh I'm just working through the steps so you know there's magic behind the curtain as as a wizard so I'm glad that you felt like I'm just moving through the steps yeah well you are the wizard because I did not feel it at all it was it's cool and for the people who who are going to get your book every chapter is just 10% 20% 30% as you go through so it did just feel like a n natural hey I'm just walking through this this is how I need to go through it and Tiffany the teacher is helping me get there and it was really great so okay I think let's start with these first five and obviously like we said there's no way in the confines of a 45 minute to an hour podcast so we could ever go through everything and and that's the whole point of the workbook this is not just a book it's a workbook and I think that's the critical part is this is really get down and dirty with your finances because you're not just sitting here at Idol taking this in right Tiffany you're giving the lesson and then there are these worksheets and you fill them in this is actual work so for people who are not looking to do any work this is not your book but for anybody who really wants to take action which is the entire point of chifi is to get up off the couch and take action this book is for you exactly I just was talking to one of my mentees this morning and he was really struggling with like how do I get to the place from where I am to where I want to be and I said well you know the steps you have the access you have the tools and he was like yeah I said you have to just decide I'm going to do something today that's so I mean that part I can't do right so I can give you the book and the worksheets and the excitement I can give you the encouragement but at something in you has to say today is the day I decide that like I am going to do better and you might even say I don't have money for the book go to the library and get made whole I don't mind you know what I mean like ask for for a gift the reason why I became a teacher and the reason why I became a financial educator and why I wrote made whole and why I do all the things is because I want my life to be in service to a greater Humanity you know I really want to give people the tools that when they do decide they're not out here alone they're like here's a tool that can help me on my financial Journey yeah Tiffany I love that and I I think that's obviously this is not about me but that's how also how I think of myself right like at this point I've reached Financial Independence I don't have to be doing this but I do it because it's a calling and I think both of us like to look at okay we're taking something complex and trying to make it understandable if not simple then certainly understandable and something that here's a stepwise process to move forward and I think what I gleaned and we will talk about each of these but one of the big things that I gleaned from the book was Automation and I wrote that down as something I wanted to talk to you about right away because I think that was a theme I saw in a number of these different ch chapters so talk me through maybe before we get into the granular like just it's the psychological right of hey where does psychology intersect with all right I need to set this on autopilot because I can't get my little brain in the way of things that's that's how I look at it no it's true so there are moments in life where it's like you just got to do it but then there are moments where it's like so for example I think of automation like meal planning and so on Sunday or whatever day you meal plan it does require you to decide and do some work in this 2our span or whatever on Sunday but then through the week because you set it up you get to automatically pull your food out of the refrigerator and so that's why automation is so powerful does it require for your finances for you to do this initial setup and initial work like one of my favorite themes from the book is something that I call split it before you get it and this is when you go to HR or payroll and say hey instead of putting all my money in this one checking account I'd like for you to split it into savings a checking account for bills a checking account for spending a savings account for long-term savings and an emergency savings account but it's going to require you to do that meal prep planning which is the math of how much needs to go to each account but after that HR can take over and you can automate your way into a better financial future and so automation is key but it cannot do what you have not told it to do right yeah that's cool and I love how you tie that into meal planning I always thought of that as frontloading the sacrifice right it's you do that little bit of extra work at the beginning that makes everything else easier down the road but like you said you have to get up off the couch and take action because it doesn't happen by itself yeah that's cool so split it before you get it I think a lot of people just heard that because my ears heard that and I was like oh wow I didn't even know you could do that I mean I think most of us know at least intellectually know all right 401K that's an option for saving clearly and I think who we both would advise you you need to get up to the employer match yada y y we could talk about the exit should you max out your 41k that's irrelevant for now but they split it before you get it I didn't know you could tell them hey put X number of dollars in this account y number of dollars in that account like talk me through that so typically it's up to four different accounts you know or sometimes more and you might think oh my company doesn't do that but you never know because here I have three full-time employees so by no means is the budget nista a huge organization but we are able to do so you know we are able to split our employees paychecks up to four ways and let's just say that you're not able because I like to have two checking two savings this is ideal for split before you get it this is going to help you with budgeting this is going to help you with savings this is going to help you with credit debt it really helps with the first four steps of made home and here's how so you go to your you know you go to HR and you do your budget ahead of time and then you're going to say this is how much I want in my initial checking account and that's the checking account that you I call it basically like your cash account where you're going to spend out of you know you're just going to swipe your debit card for food for grooming and things like that and then your second checking account that you're going to have HR deposit the money in is your bills account and you you know this is probably where most of your money for being candid for most people is going to go but the beauty of having a separate checking account for spending and bills is that you are going to divorce your debit card from your bills account so when you're swiping at your local Target you know there's no way I'm swiping my bill money I don't think people realize you can have a choice Brad not to have a debit card attached to your account you can say yeah yeah yeah just take that off the account and that allows you that when you're out spending you're not like wait wait wait did I no no it's not okay it's not I haven't I'm not swiping away my bill money and if we further the automation you know if you know you make enough to cover your bills you can automate your bills from that bills account and when you pay on time payment history is 35% of your credit score so automating payments will one you know help to lower debt automatically and help with 35% of your credit score you know and then the second half of split it before you get it is savings and so putting money you know like you no longer have to ask yourself did I put money in my savings account I prefer to have two savings accounts at a different bank an online only high yield savings account because I like it separate from my regular brick-and mortar bank so for checking ease and convenience is key for savings inconvenience is key you know because if you're anything like me I love Target right it used to be like I would look at my checking and say ooh I really could use that bowl and I want this bowl or blender or whatever thing I'm not going to use and then my checking would say Tiffany there's no money here or it's not enough and my savings would say like we have money and I would make the transfer on my phone but with my savings at another bank you're looking at at minimum 24 hours before that money goes from your savings to your checking so unless I have a sleeping bag I'm not going to get that thing at Target and so it makes me pause and say you don't even need that anyway Tiffany so I like to have short-term savings which is what I call emergency savings ideally three months or more if you're anything like me I have a year just because I'm always paranoid you know and it really depends I say minimum three months then look at your industry my mom before she retired was a nurse three months was plenty sure even before the pandemic because nurses were always in high demand my sister a mechanical engineer she needed six months or more because it took a long time to replace her job when she lost it so three months is the Baseline and then you look at your industry and say how long would it take for me to replace my income then the second savings account at that online only bank is long-term savings are you looking to buy a house or a car are you looking to start investing that's where you can start to put that money and then transfer it to whatever investment account that you might do later so split it before you get it what I love is it takes care of the first four steps of financial wholeness budgeting savings debt credit right there huh that is amazing that I'm I'm flabber guess it honestly I I don't say that lightly because yeah the intersection I'm looking at literally your summary of the 10 and it really does cover that and that's that beauty of the automation eventually right and that doesn't start on day one no but if you can get this to the point where again it's predicated on having that little bit of space in your budget right like if you're saving every month you can get to that point where this is then all just on autopilot right like you have that X number of month emergency fund whether it's 3 6 12 whatever it may be and then right you have the automatic sa okay yeah the pieces are all falling together from me now here's the thing Brad if you're like me when I first started it was like split it but I didn't get it because I didn't have enough money to put into savings it literally was like 95% if not 110% of my money went into bills yeah because I didn't have anything excess and if anything I was in a deficit and that's okay it's knowing the parameters and then one day was like okay I have enough to pay my bills it was like after the recession lost my job I was just in a negative and some bills just didn't get paid you know but knowing like what you're working toward is really helpful like so candidly I told myself I'm like Tiffany I walk every day I love to walk which is great but I know that I need to wait train I know I need to wait train and this morning I was like what are we deciding this morning Tiffany I was like I need wa I don't know why I'm like I used to love the gym but I'm so adverse to it now I said let's start with calisthetics because these are push-ups chinups you know you don't need any equipment yeah body weight yes and so honestly I couldn't do a dip my arms were like girl we have not used you in this Tri what so then what I realized is like I could do squats okay I could do like one or two dips I could do one or two chin-ups meaning I didn't have the excess left over yeah to like fulfill those things but it doesn't mean I'm like I'm looking at I'm like all right well every day I'm still going to try and one day I'm going to have $5 and that's what I started with with savings and then 10 a month and then 50 and then 100 and so just because you can't fully complete it doesn't mean every day you don't try because eventually if you can decide on doing the work every day then eventually there will be money to put there and eventually you guys GNA see me I'm gonna you know my arms will be ripped I love it that'll be the YouTube channel next time we uh I love how you said decide to do the work because really that's the key to success in life right it's deciding to do the work and sometimes most of the time the work takes a long time right like success very rarely happens overnight for anybody I've gotten fitter than I've ever been I'm 44 years old and and it me too 44 too my birthday was just just a couple weeks ago oh sweet so we're within a couple months of each other I like it uh yeah I mean you can get fit at any age but it starts from day one it starts from like you said those first couple push-ups that first dip or two and you just have to keep at it you have to keep adding you keep a log book and hey I did two last time and five push-ups I want to do one more yep and you just keep moving and like you said maybe that savings goal starts from $ five doar that very first time and that's fine okay sure it'll be wonderful someday when you do number five the Learn to Earn and you start earning more income and that could be $1,000 a week who knows a week right $50,000 I mean some crazy number but you can't aspire to that on day one you just can't sometimes day one is just opening up the bank account yeah like there's no money but because you know savings accounts are free yeah you know so sometimes day one is just I'm just gonna search for a great bank account based upon the criteria Tiffany listed and made whole I found one and I'm just going to open it you know and that's it because it's like I am setting myself up because I told myself like uh you know initially of course I was like I can't even do a pushup really and then I was like like but you can do a modified version Tiffany where you can either push against the wall or you can use a chair you can use a table and I was like if you can do one just do one and then if you keep doing one then you'll be able to do two so it's really success is cumulative action you know and so that's that's the key the teacher in me especially the preschool teacher in me you know that is the space that I teach from is that like I don't have this expectation that a three-year-old is going to come into the classroom knowing how to read that's just not how that goes so what do we do as teachers we're like this is a that's what we start with and literally by the end of the year some of these kids are reading and they didn't even know a in the beginning of the year but we give Grace and space to our three and four year old self about learning that we know it's cumulative we learn a that we learned a says a then we also learned apple and before you know it because every day we're reinforcing those good behaviors literally I had kids that came in you know I was like a like apple and they're like what's an apple I'm like well we got a long way to go but by the end of the year here they're reading and so I just I want people to give themselves who are listening the grace and space you don't have to show up perfectly but you do have to show up yeah it's funny Grace and space were the exact words I was just going to use Tiffany I I swear it's not being ashamed yeah right in any aspect and it's not being too proud I think even talking about the gym again just going back to that I see so many people at the gym who are trying to impress other people they're lifting heavier weights than they possibly could do they're swinging them with their entire bodies and it's like just drop the weight drop the weight significantly and do it right it's the same with personal finance it's the same with anything right like you don't have to impress anybody but set the stage get those habits like you were describing hey just setting up the online bank account it reminds me of James CLE and sorry to keep talking about the gym but like James CLE talking about hey love that book right like it's a brilliant brilliant book and just going to the gym for a minute or two M and just coming back home but establishing The Habit it sounds so ridiculous like I can't imagine anybody doing that but if you did it I bet that habit would be ingrained waking up getting ready going to the gym doing one thing coming back home and then just a little bit better so you know enough about the gym but no but I love that Brad honestly because I think what what we're both trying to illustrate here is that you don't have to show up perfectly and ideally too not even showing up alone so one of the chapters is about building a financial team this is in the second half of the 10 steps right and so like I make suggestions of who might be on your team but there's one person in particular that everyone should have on their team and that's an accountability partner that money is a team sport is it your bestie from high school is it your partner is it your kid you know maybe it's your mom your cousin your dad your brother your sister whomever that navigating and they don't have to have Financial knowledge they're there to cheer you on and you are there to cheer them on and so like when I was talking to one of my mentees this morning and I was telling him you have to decide you know he was like okay can you cuz he's really really fit you know and so he was the one who was giving me like suggestions about modified ways I was like I couldn't even do one dip he was like did you try it like this I was like okay and so he was like well can you help to motivate me on my financial journey and I'll help to motivate you as you try to get back um fit and so having an accountability partner who is not there to make you feel bad they're there to provide a safe space for you you don't have to show up perfectly but they're there to encourage you to show up you know and so like when it comes to your money I don't believe people should do money alone I share how to look for one what to look for and even if you can't find one I have an amazing group of people that I call dream catchers so in the book I give you the link to access like if you are out there by yourself or you think so you don't have to be because there are over two million dream catches worldwide I have a number of dreamcatcher groups upwards of 500 600,000 people and some as small as 10,000 so if you're looking around in your life and you don't have a financial accountability partner you will find one when reading the book yeah that is absolutely true it it's funny I was in your in one of your Facebook groups with you have 486,000 people which is just crazy I I think our our group has like a 100 plus and I'm like oh that's a pretty big group and damn Tiffany the dream catchers are just a remarkable remarkable group and yeah for anybody in the FI World who's looking obviously we have choosefi local groups so chi.com looc and you can find people in your exact area who are pursuing fi so I think clearly there so many dream catchers there's so many people pursuing fi you can find that accountability partner and yeah I know from firsthand experience it works so well with Fitness and just seeing the translation as you're saying like you shouldn't do money alone and I think so many of us just sit in silence right and we just we're afraid of money we don't want to talk about it but when you normalize talking about it all of a sudden it's not so scary all of a sudden that question you have that you're afraid somebody's going to think you're stupid or you should have learned this or whatever ridiculous limiting belief you have you can ask it because you don't feel silly anymore so yeah that's brilliant yeah one of the things I like I have this amazing therapist and she told me I remember one time I was like how does somebody get rid of Shame you know because I remember distinctly when you know I know you you were my first book get go with money I talk about Jake the thief and how I was this I want to say victim but I guess of like a fraud that left me $35,000 in debt and I was so ashamed of myself I was like almost immovable for a year I didn't want to tell anyone my father was a a CPA like you and a CFO at one point I was like I cannot tell him he's gonna be like after all that I've taught you what is going on you know and I was so ashamed I was Frozen with fear and the only thing that released me this is why I'm so adamant about having a financial accountability partner is finally my best friend as best friends are apt to she was like what's going on with you and didn't want to tell her she's like this obviously something because you're not acting like yourself I broke down in tears and I told my best friend Linda you know I'm $35,000 in credit card debt I just lost my job as a teacher because of the recession and I have this condo that I bought at the time I was in my 20s I bought a condo when I was 25 I can't afford the mortgage and I'm gonna lose the condo I don't know what to do I'm drowning and I was like and I have to move back home with my parents you know and she was like well I'm calling you from my mom's couch so I don't know that and she said it like that and we both started laughing and it was the first time in a year that I didn't feel as much shame and I asked my therapist about this years later and she said because the only way to really shake shame is to give voice to it to say the thing out loud to someone that you trust and she said that's why you were able to release some of it because you told Linda you trusted her and she was a safe space to land and her reaction to you was like okay and you know and what it did was that when you release shame because shame Shields Solutions when you release shame you start to realize wait I do actually have a solution I could try over here and I could also probably do this and before I knew it I started those first five steps I'm like Tiffany you know how to budget even on unemployment and you know what you've gotten really good at saving and you know what your credit is actually not so bad considering and you know what despite this $35,000 in debt you know if you're a really good saver you could put some of that savings toward paying down debt and you know what you can babysit you can tutor you can you know to Learn to Earn these are the first five steps and I because I was able to release some of that shame I was able to lean into the solutions for my financial mishaps yeah that's really really great put a voice to it and yes I know you said before you have some maybe some steps for what to look for in an accountability partner clearly we said people can find an accountability partner certainly through dream catchers through Choi wherever but what would be one or two things that you would advise for somebody listening to this who wants to take action so if you're looking for an accountability partner ideally you're wanting someone who was actively working on their Journey too whether imperfectly or not so for example let's just say I'm working to learn to invest even if they're not looking to invest although it's helpful because I want to be able to bounce off like did you read that article what did you think it meant or I was reading the chart and I don't get it do you get it so at the very least that they're working on their holistic Financial Journey but ideally someone who's working on particular part of the journey that you are too but it doesn't have to be that but they do have to be working on their financial Journey so that's one two it should be a no judgment Zone on both sides like life is hard enough so you don't want an accountability partner like you know you love your mom but if mom is gonna make you feel like again with a credit card debt you're like you know what Mom I'm not I used to say like I love my parents but they could be a little judging I used to always say like oh my gosh my parents are on a need to know basis and they don't need to know so like my sisters I have four sisters they were awesome I could be like and then I did this and then I met you know so it doesn't mean that you love somebody less or whatever but you know your people yeah and especially my dad was a CPA and account so he could not even wrap my his head around like the choices that I had made you know so I just knew that at least this part of my journey that I let him know when I'm out of it and so you want no judgment Zone and someone who is also working on their financial Journey at least those two things yeah that is a great great place to start okay I wanted to go back to the split it before you get it because I think my mind is just spinning with this it's incredible and I think this really is the fundamental piece of everything so let's talk just really granular about those two checking accounts okay again people can get it from the book and I hope that they do but I want them to leave this episode with okay I really understand this now so you have the the bills account yes and then you have the other kind of cash spending account account talk me through like okay clearly bills are or at least as I'm conceptualizing it it's like the monthly recurring things that you know would groceries count in bills or is that in the spending like talk us through at a real high level like how you kind of split these two out so the teacher and me was like okay how do I make sure the student when they're reading made hole knows how to do because you sound literally like how everyone's like wait wait wait I need you to break down the homework so so what I do in the budget chapter of ma whole is I have you out all of your expenditures that you can think about so you know mortgage rent car note groceries grooming kids credit card debt just list it all out and list it all out without the numbers at first because it's easy to forget things if you're worried about those two things just list the names first and of all the things you spend money on if you're not sure you take out your debit card or your credit card and kind of look there you know and then the second step is to write down how much these things cost you in a monthly way so I live in New York New Jersey we pay our water bill every three months and it's like $41 or something like that and so right and so so what that means is that you know it's like what $11 a month even though you know because I have to divide $41 into three and so the same thing for like say if you get a haircut you know maybe your haircut is you know $40 and it's twice a month so then you multiply $40 times two 80 bucks so second step is how much does everything cost me monthly right and then I want you to start so this is my favorite part of the budgeting process that I kind of came up with for myself many years ago is I like to code the things on my list I call it my money list because some people don't like the word budget I'm like okay I call it my money list I like to code them and I say first you start with anything that's a bill put a b next to it on your money list and think about a bill is if you don't pay it someone's goingon to come knock it on your door basically you know cuz sometimes people like what how do I know this is well this is going to answer the question of where the money should go as far as the accounts right so is someone going to come knock it on your door if you don't buy these groceries no is someone gonna come knocking on your door if you don't get the haircut no is someone GNA come knocking on your door if you don't pay your mortgage your rent car note things like that yes put a b next to all those things you know and then anything that fluctuates so these are bills that basically go up and down based upon your usage I call these kind of like usage bills you're going to put a u in front of that b so these are typically your utilities so the U stands for utilities usage up and down so okay so it's probably only to be a few things like your water bill your lights you know it depends but for the most part it's just gonna be a handful of things so now you have things that are labeled B things that are labeled UB anything that's not labeled b or U is C C stands for cash expenses or choices this is where you have the most choices and so now when it's time to split it before you get it you're going to say anything that has a c in front of it that's going to go into my spending account monthly because you're gonna add up remember we did step one what do I spend money on step two how much does it cost me monthly so you're GNA add up all those CES and let's say comes up to $500 then you know on average that you should be putting about $500 in your spending checking account because those are your C's this is where you're going to swipe your debit card with everything else those bees and ues are going to go into that bills account because those are bills that you've identified some bills are more fixed some bills are more variable bills you know but it's going to go into that account and that's how you know how to split because so when you go food shopping or or you know maybe go to birthday party for the kids or whatever and you swipe your card you know you're not spending your bills or your utility bills money ideally as you have enough you'll be able to automate the bills so you don't even have to think about it they're just paid so literally it's like you get paid from work the money lands in your bills account and the bills account self pays itself out but you see that initial meal prep that we had to do in the beginning it was like how much do I spend money you know like what are the things I spend money on how much does it cost me monthly which ones are B's which ones are ub's the rest are C's and honestly that work maybe 30 minutes and then you're like now I know my amount let me take these amounts with me to work and say hey do you split our paycheck how and let's just say worst case scenario they say Brad we actually can't split your paycheck we don't have the capability so then you can still have all of your money land in that initial checking account and then you can either manually split yourself or if you know you get paid on the first and the 15th you can have that checking account automatically spit like on the second or the third or the 15th or the 16th you see what I mean meaning like the account itself can do the splitting for you since you know when you get paid yeah that makes perfect sense so so right two things come to mind first as you were saying it's only going to be 30 minutes but my mind went to it's such a mental hurdle I think that's the thing you're trying to teach people to overcome yes right like if you just put the work in that one time everything else gets easier and it's maybe 30 minutes maybe an hour right to actually do that and that's it's done hours everything though right so that this is when you pull in your accountability partner hey Linda what are you doing this weekend uh nothing can you come by the house I'm trying to do this budget hly I'm not going to lie it just feels so overwhelming okay she doesn't even have to be working on a budget sometimes I just need someone to sit next to me and be like oh what's that you know what I mean yeah like just to sit and then afterwards you know we'll cook and laugh or watch TV or whatever and so in those moments when you need that boost you could pull in your accountability partner this is why I call it Financial wholeness because holistically I want to address all the things that are holding you back from achieving your the goals that you're wanting you know as it relates to life and your money and so it's not enough because Brad we all know like how to be fit Eat Right exercise sleep you know move your body we know yeah yet how many people don't do that for that very reason 20 minutes a day it's only 20 minutes a day even this morning I was like uh I'm like you work for yourself you literally could do whatever you want and I am financially free as well so I'm like I could really do whatever I want are you kidding me you can't do 20 minutes you know but that's why I called he was my mentee but also my accountability partner he was like okay I know you're frustrated because you can't do try the dips this way I was like okay and he was like you got squats down don't worry about it a lot of people can't do push-ups you know do it against the wall that was easy try against the chair that's a little harder try the tables a little high so you know I needed that person in the room with me and there's nothing wrong with that I want you can hear the sound of my voice I want you to get very comfortable with asking for help sooner rather than later you know that you don't have to do it alone I want you to as soon as you're like there's friction here how can I receive help is it buying a book listening to choose VI a podcast is it like getting an accountability partner like I want us all to get very comfortable with asking for help and seeking that out because to suffer and silence I mean you don't get any brownie points for that no no you do not it reminds me of kind of the motto of a mastermind group that I'm in with a a guest who's been on one of my good buddies his name is Dominic cucho and he runs basically a men's group Mastermind that I'm a part of and it's don't loan wolf your life and just think of how powerful that is and like that just is so evocative it's just don't loan wolf your life no matter what aspect that is and like you're saying ask early be on the early side don't wait and suffer in silence until everything is crumbling around you and then and only then you ask for help be proactive don't be ashamed right Tiffany I mean I think that's what we're trying to get across here is don't be ashamed and I think a lot of it then it's the accountability but it's also just having this fundamental knowledge and and that's why I'm really trying to dive in on this because it's it's so wonderful how you think about this so okay this split it before you get it so you just describe so beautifully how we split these accounts with the B the UB the C's so as I'm understanding it from my own brain If This Were Me setting this up I would have both of those checking accounts at the same bank yes right because especially then those transfers and I think that was the key if your employer can't do it for you it doesn't mean you go home and say ah I tried but it it doesn't work you can still do this right TIY just gave you the answer which is you send all the money into the one account and then a day or two later you have that automated transfer into the next account and it's made dramatically Easier by being at the same bank and that's why I assume that which you just collaborated so now let's talk again if you don't mind about the two savings accounts so now you said very explicitly you do not want them at the same banking institution no right so talk us through that and are they both the online savings account the high yield or how do you think about the two different savings accounts at least to start I want you to have you know both high yield because if you're going to save you might as well make some money you know more money than like at a brick-and mortar bank that's where I'm assuming you're going to have your checking at and so you want them separate because one the same way you want the ease of like checking to go from your spending account to your bills account you want that ease of back and forth you want to disease when it comes from checking to savings yeah friction friction friction yes because I always say that you want to make your money inconvenient because inconvenient money gets saved and so you want U I like online only banks because one they tend to pay higher interest because they don't have the brick and mortar overhead you're going to look for a bank that's FDIC insured you're going to look for like obviously the highest interest that can be yielded ideally you want to look for a bank that you can connect to your current brick-and mortar bank or wherever your checking account is because you want to be able ble to make transfers if if necessary because if there is an emergency you want to be able to transfer the money and get to your money sure because some online only banks are so small it's like you know they have a hard time connecting to other Banks so you definitely want to make sure that you have a a bank that is able to connect and you can not wire but transfer because wiring you know you're going to pay a fee there but transfer should be free and so I like to have two savings and you can have as many as you want but this is kind of like my introductory to I like to have savings for emergencies and so even now I am financially free but I like to have a Year's worth of savings just because I have been very very very very very very very broke and so I still have a little I call it post-traumatic broke syndrome I still have a little bit of that and so I have a Year's worth of savings but it's I have since transferred it out from my savings account and I put it in like a high yield 12- month CD that was like the time it was like a great interest rate because I'm like I don't really need it but for my own it's my safety blanket y but for someone starting out you're going to want one account that you're going to be saving you're going to work toward getting up to three months of what your expenses cost and it doesn't have to be three months of like your full life so let's just say your full life cost you $4,000 a month you know and that is like going out with friends your rent your bills but also it's like all the non- Necessities as well so your first order of business is is going to be to find out what I call your noodle budget is going to be this is if you have had to eat ramen noodles so that means like oh my gosh I lost my job so I'm not going out I can cut my own hair I don't need to get my toes done you know like I'm not gonna go you know brunch on Sunday I'm GNA reduce all those things and instead of my life costing me $4,000 a month I can get my life down to 3,000 that's my noodle budget life then that's the number 3,000 times three months that I'm working toward getting $9,000 put up you know because you want to remember that the instant that you lose access to earning money you want to drop down and get your noodle on you want to start to live at your noodle budget right away get the noodle on yes and so that's the first savings account and the second really is like goal savings that's up to you are you trying to buy a home or a car something that you're working toward in the next year you know because excess savings is is bad you want to be able to anything super excess should be put to work it should be invested somewhere you know but sometimes I call this like my pre-investment account so let's just say I want to enter into the market or you know I do want to buy a property and I I need that money on hand so I don't want it in the market because I'm going to be putting a down payment on it within a year so this is where I would save for something a goal that I'm trying to accomplish within like a year and I don't want I want the money to be relatively liquid or liquid so I can you know if the house comes on the market I'm not like oh I gotta you know liquidate that stock or sell it in order to get access but you don't want to be like me where I had way too much in that account and my my financial advisor at the time she was like Tiffany this is ridiculous like are you are you looking to buy an apartment cash like what are we doing here an apartment complex maybe I mean so now the truth is for me there's no quote unquote gold that I'm saving for so when I was um I I'm not quite self-employed because I'm an employee of my business but when I was like self-employed self-employed I used to put my taxes in that account because I knew I had to pay taxes so that's where I would kind of keep that money because when you work for your company like I'm an employee of the budget nista you know taxes come out and things like that but before then I was a true entrepreneur and I had to like just like a contractor I had to set aside tax money you know so that account because of where I am now in my life I don't really have any money in that account because there's nothing that I'm saving for because you see what I mean Brad like I do it doesn't make sense to have a pile of money I'm like I put it to work I'm like you already have a Year's worth of emergency savings your checking account is fine for bills your checking account for spending is is fine is there something you're saving for Tiffany uh no so then I'm like all right then put that money to work so that second savings account is really for goals that you have upcoming if there's nothing you're saving for you don't have to keep anything in there but those are the four accounts that I like for people to consider to start with okay I love that and I'm so glad you clarified it that that last piece because that was my next question is more for the advanced people right if you will is okay I'm financially stable I have my emergency fund whether that's 36 12 months whatever it may be that's in my savings do I really need that other savings account and it sounds like no ultimately right and I think you described in there again the mental hurdle it's funny how that keeps coming up the mental hurdle of selling stock which is great actually and in a large degree because again it's friction right we want to add friction in where it doesn't cause us to make silly mistakes basically but that said for everybody listening it actually is pretty easy to sell stocks right and you can sell it or sell a mutual fund the next day make the transfer and then two or three days later it's in your bank account so it's not inaccessible but I think we should think of it as something that we don't want to touch that we don't want to sell because that friction it's not as easy as being like transfer for my savings exactly and so for me that's why I was like Tiffany there's too much here it's too accessible for something you're not saving for anything so why put it to work you know like literally put that money to work yeah know EX exactly especially in that until recently until the last year interest rates have been virtually zero so even in this quote unquote high yield savings account you were probably earning I don't know 1% plus or minus exactly it's nonsensical I will say this because sometimes people push back on me on emergency savings because they feel like they should put it to work Beyond a high yield savings account especially people who are quote unquote Advanced and I say this it's the difference between a seat belt and a Gucci belt right so your emergency savings it's a seat belt it's not meant to be cute it's this year for protection and I get it yes I would love for every single nickel penny dime to be actively working toward growing me wealth but there is some money that's not there to grow wealth it's just there for protection the seat belt is not there to be cute it's just there you know like I can make it as cute as possible meaning like I'll put in a high yield savings or like a long-term CD or something you know but yes the other money is a Gucci BT get it as cute as possible put it out there to work you know Having excess savings is is a terrible idea you know but whatever a seat belt looks like for you whether it's 3 months six months whatever that looks like like put on your seat belt and don't worry about it being looking like a Gucci belt it's not me yeah that's great that's a cool way to think about it so it's funny because this is something we've gone back and forth with on the podcast so we had uh big ER from early retirement now who's basically the smartest person in personal finance he was on way back when in episode 66 talking about hey do people pursuing fi actually need an emergency fund as we conceptualize it and and I think we can make arguments around it but what ultimately matters is you feel confident right I think that's how I would Define it so for me I don't technically have an emergency fund of money just sitting idle waiting for me to lose a job or something like that but what I do have and what what is that lowkey belt for me is I have an extra probably $10,000 in my checking account okay that just sits there and if I had a a large expense I say life is Lumpy right like hey some it doesn't mean it's an emergency it just means hey life is Lumpy sometimes and something breaks or whatever like I have a big credit card bill I don't want to stress TI I want to lower stress in my financial life so that's what does it for me and then I know I have a significant net worth and look if I needed to sell some mutual funds which I don't want to do could yes and I love that it's really about because you're right the reason why I have so much set aside is because I have post-traumatic brok syndrome yeah yeah and I'm I'm slowly coming out of it because even as I'm talking I'm thinking Tiffany you could do six months yeah you know so maybe next year I'll tell anelie my financial adviser all right I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready to do six months and then maybe a year from now it's like Tiffany you really could do three months but what I'm trying to provide in made home is this General framework that you then fit your life and you you mold it it's almost like you get a suit for Macy's and then you go get it tailored to you and so I'm just Macy's you know this is not like you know you don't have to wear it off the rack but it's at least a good place to start because to your point Brad you're like I don't need emergency savings and for you and truthfully I probably don't need it either it's but for my own confidence and mental well-being right now I'm like I know I can't go back to losing everything again but I'm feeling a little less afraid so I can probably relinquish and when this you know CD comes to maturation I probably will relinquish and then relinquish some more to the level of how I feel confident you know what I mean and so like I think that's really critical personal finance is personal so there's no judgment here it's just like get your suit from Macy's and then have it tailored to you specifically yeah that's great and I think we're all dealing with some type of post-traumatic syndrome with our money whether it's broke or making some silly mistake or getting started too late or whatever it is that you have that's a limiting belief but is just stuck in there like I have it with real estate mistakes that I've made in the past and like I remember losing a lot of sleep over that and I have vowed I will never make a similar mistake again and i' I've learned something but Tiffany it's still there that that syndrome it's still in me you you know we first started the podcast you like Tiffany say something for a few seconds because I'm assuming at one point you probably taped and you know like one out of over your how many hundreds of podcast 600 yes and still you're like wait wait wait okay I can hear the sound but that's you know we're human yeah you know we're human and so it is okay to create safety nets around you within reason you know so I know that even I mean I'm still on my financial Journey so it's just like okay Tiffany you don't need that much can you do this how do you feel okay you feel more confident then what about this how do you feel you know and so that's really the key is that you are actively designing your life for what feels right for you even though to your point Brad like if I had no emergency savings I'd be fine I make plenty you know but internally I'd be screaming right right i' be screaming because what's going to happen business going to go in flames you come with any story right but I'm like so then who does that benefit so yes my money be making more money but I'd be screaming on the inside so I'm like What's the balance of like calm Tiffany and then not too much excess and so every year we could just withdraw just a little bit Tiffany you know until like I still feel calm so yeah yeah so safety nets within reason that's a great quote and and right like understanding that you are designing this life and it's a life you're just you're going through it you're doing the best you can you understand that things change yes and sometimes frankly they change and many times that's the whole point of putting in the work is it changes for the better and you might have started with a 12-month emergency fund because you had that that really PTSD and and now it's maybe maybe six months maybe we could get it down to three right and like you know again changing for the better the other cool thing is like we kind of alluded to is high yield savings rates are fantastic now yeah I know uh the one that I use is CIT bank it's oh nice okay so yeah for anybody who's looking for choose fi.com CIT I think at the time we're recording this at the end of October the Platinum account is 5.05% which is crazy town I mean Tiffany we're both the same age as we as we deduced like I remember getting out of college in 2001 an ING Direct Bank was like the first online bank and it was 5% yes right and like I dreamed for now almost 15 years like oh I'll never see that it'll never never come back now here we are yeah it was crazy because I wrote my very first book one week budget and I referenced it I was like reading it over this is a self-published book and at the time I it was was in was that orange the orange it was it was the orange circle yeah yes and I remember I referenced the amount like the percentage you know what you can earn and I was like there's no way because I wrote it back then in 2001 or whatever and I was like is that how much interest rates which seemed so normal back then I think I wrote like casually like get your interest rate 5% it's like yeah as if it's Common Place yeah it's crazy I didn't know any better back then but no but but yeah absolutely so yes here's the thing that I've learned about personal so I'll give you an example like I'm the house I live in now I I bought it foreclosure it was 180 I put about 180 into it for renovations and at the time so it's like six something I think at the time it was worth like 680 so I put about not 680 it was worth 380 and I put about 360 into it so I already had some a little Equity built in but because of the craziness of post pandemic and people buying my house is worth about 520 now which is incredible you know and I was just like okay and then recently I bought a condo around the corner for my house and my financial adviser knows me she's like Tiffany I know you're gonna want to buy a cash I'm like I do she was really do I do because she knows because I lost my home my first home at 25 I am traumatized and I told her I said I do it was about $520,000 and I said if I do anelie is this going to negatively affect my financial life she said no but obviously I would prefer for you you know like to put you know significant amount of money down and then let's put the other money to work in the market but I had to make a decision between the Financial Choice which is not going to harm me and the emotional choice I need to feel safe because I knew that i b it earlier this year I could tell this was going to be a harder year in business than most I could I just knew and sure enough it was but I could just tell and I said to add on a mortgage even though one that I could afford it was a level of stress that I just would didn't want to take on so she presented the two things it was like you know you're high net worth individual I can get you a better interest rate than what's available like publicly but certainly you could buy this place for 520 it's not going to harm you you had really great last few years you know you're still fine Tiffany you still don't have to work if you don't want to work and so basically now you get to make a choice and this is the idea Brad you get to make a choice about what's best free you not just what's the best money choice and that's what I want people to get to and I decided I bought the house cash I love it I did because I was just like Tiffany like I don't have a mortgage you know on that place either but I also still don't have to work anymore if I don't want to you know and so that is the ideal is when to me I want to work hard enough where I don't have to make a choice based upon what's best for money because it's inconsequential not not the 500,000 is inconsequent you know what I mean but like I I remember Oprah one time I heard her say she was was at a shop and it was between she really loved a sweater but it was $700 and she was like oh I don't know if I should get the blue one or the black one oh I don't know I don't know and Gail was like are you kidding me she's like oh get both right you're a multibillionaire yes but that's what I mean like I don't want to carry that thinking where it's like you literally have more than enough like even though it might not make Financial sense to get two $700 sweaters it's not going to shift the needle for you in a negative way and so that's what I'm wanting for myself and for other people and why I wrote made whole Tiffany that is the perfect place to leave it this has been amazing right we talked about really this master class on budgeting and and it all starts with split
