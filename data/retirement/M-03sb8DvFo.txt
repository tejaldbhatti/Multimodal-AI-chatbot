the hardest part about planning for retirement is that the future is so uncertain you have no idea what the stock market might do next what will happen with inflation how long you'll live which makes deciding when you can retire and how much income you can draw seem like an impossible task but there is one tool that can solve all of these problems for you over the last 10 years it has fallen out of favor but now with interest rates on the rise I see this strategy becoming the Cornerstone of many people's retirement plans so in this video I'm going to show you how this strategy works why it's so effective but also why so many people hate it so you can decide whether this will work for you thank you foreign [Music] if you're new here hi my name is James I am a financial planner and a few weeks ago I was speaking with a gentleman called Tim who had gone in touch with me through YouTube and was grappling with this exact problem he was 57 and looking to retire imminently between him and his wife they had 500 000 pounds in their pensions and they were looking to spend 35 000 pounds per year in retirement twenty thousand pounds of that would have covered their core expenditure and enabled them to live a modest life and the other fifteen thousand pounds would be discretionary spending that would give them the retirement that they had been looking forward to Tim had plugged these numbers into my cash flow planner which indicated that he would run out of money at age 85 but the problem is that given that Tim's life expectancy is 84 years old he almost has a 50 50 chance of running out of money before he dies but then when you take into consideration his wife there is a one in three chance that at least one of them will live well into their 90s Tim knew that he could just work for longer or spend less in retirement but because one of his close friends had recently died in their early 60s before they'd got the chance to actually spend any of their money and enjoy retirement Tim was desperate to make sure that this didn't happen to him he wanted to get his time back and live his life while he still can but all the unknowns of the future have been driving him around in circles unable to make a decision and like many Tim had also been watching the value of his pension drop dramatically over the last year whilst his cost of living has also been going through the roof which has knackered his nerves and made him realize that he can no longer stomach being a higher risk investor ideally Tim would like a steady stream of income that can cover his core expenditure and if he has that sorted he'd be much more comfortable taking risks with his discretionary spending and varying it depending on the performance of his Investments but there is a textbook solution to this problem a tool that can provide Tim with a guaranteed income for life no matter how long he lives and on paper this could significantly increase increase his chances of success you see it's impossible to know whether any one individual will die in a given year but when we're dealing with tens or hundreds of thousands of people it's possible to accurately predict What proportion will die each year this is known as the law of large numbers and is the basis for all Insurance products take car insurance as an example we have no idea which individuals might have an accident in any given year but across a hundred thousand people it's possible to accurately predict Which percentage of us will have accidents and estimate those costs and by spreading that cost across a hundred thousand people with yearly insurance premiums we can ensure everyone against that risk in the same way the law of large numbers enables us to ensure against the risk of outliving our money in retirement if we take ten thousand sixty year old males we have no idea which individuals might die in a given year but we can accurately predict what percentage will according to the most recent mortality tables between 60 61 we should expect 0.7 percent to Die the next year 0.8 percent the year after 0.9 percent and on and on up until 100 where we expect to see 33 die each year because this data is so reliable we can build an insurance product around it that can pay all members a guaranteed income for life this product is known as an annuity and just like car insurance it can provide a much better result than if you were going to try and ensure against this risk on your own let me show you why let's say you're 60 years old and you're fed up with the insecurity of the stock market and instead you want to create a guaranteed income for life even if you live to 100 you could solve this problem by investing in a portfolio of government bonds known as a bond ladder if you had one hundred thousand pounds to invest in this strategy and the interest rate on government bonds was four percent you could draw 5052 pounds every year in year one four thousand pounds of that income would come from the four percent interest you earn on the bonds and 1052 would come from drawing down on the principle each year as your principal gets smaller so does the interest that you earn so the difference needs to be made up by drawing more and more from your principle until you finally end up depleting the portfolio at 100 years old if you want a guaranteed income for life this is how you do it well almost if inflation is running at three percent per year in 20 years time that 5 000 pounds will only buy you half what it does today and in 40 years time it'll be worth just 1 400 pounds so instead you could invest in inflation-protected government bonds or index linkers in the UK that will increase their payouts in line with inflation with this strategy you would start by drawing 3045 pounds per year but this would increase in line with inflation until eventually it starts to pay out more than the normal strategy of course if inflation ends up being higher than expected you'll break even much more quickly I know that three thousand pounds per year doesn't sound like much but this just shows you how valuable a guarantee inflation-protected income is which includes things like the state pension and many defined benefit pensions either way if you want to build yourself a guaranteed income for life this is how you do it but in reality building a bond ladder is quite Technical and there's a high chance that you'll die with a fair amount of money left over an annuity solves this problem and with interest rates at four percent an annuity could pay out 6558 pounds per year so that's 30 more than you'd get from doing this on your own but how does this work well an annuity is a product run by an insurance company you give the insurer a lump sum of cash and in return they will pay you a guaranteed income for life in the UK you typically use part of your defined contribution pension to buy an annuity between Tim and his wife they have 500 000 pounds in pensions so they could first take their 25 tax-free cash and then use the rest of their pension to you buy an annuity this income is then taxed at their marginal income tax rates and of course you can only do this once you are able to access your pensions at 55. you also have the option of adding protection against inflation or guarantees that pay out a lump sum if you die within a set period but each of these protections that you add reduces the income that you will receive generally regulated annuities have 100 fscs protection meaning the government will guarantee that income even if the insurer goes bust to provide that guaranteed income the insurer will invest in exactly the same type of bonds that you would do if you were trying to do this on your own so how then are they able to pay out a much higher level of income well given that annuities are made up of tens of thousands of members insurers can accurately predict What proportion of those will die each year and use the funds from those that die earlier to balance out those that live longer so in effect they only need to plan for the average life expectancy of the group rather than all the way up to 100 it which enables them to pay out much higher starting sums to everybody annuities have been unpopular for a very long time because the rates that they pay are directly linked to interest rates but over the last year as rates have been rising annuity rates have shot up to levels not seen for 15 years so how could Tim use an annuity to give him more financial stability and enable him to retire with confidence Tim has core expenditure of 20 000 pounds per year and a desired discretionary spend of fifteen thousand pounds with this dropping to ten thousand pounds from age 75. in their situation buying a full lifetime annuity at retirement might not make sense because from 67 their state pensions will kick in and cover the majority of their core costs but Tim could use a fixed term annuity to cover the period up to that point you can use the money helper site to compare annuity quotes which can vary dramatically depending on your age health and where you live so if you're interested in seeing what you might be able to get I've left a link to this down in the description in Tim's situation twenty thousand pounds per year for 10 years would cost him 161 000 pounds remember a big chunk of that 20 000 pound payment is Tim's own Capital being returned to him but the internal rate of return still equates to four percent per year which is slightly above the current yield on government bonds of 3.6 to be more tax efficient he could buy half the annuity and his wife could buy the other half to make use of both of their income tax allowances although we do need to remember that because this is a level annuity it has no inflation protection so the value of those twenty thousand pound payments will fall in real terms over the years but even so this would provide Tim with an income flaw to cover most of his core expenses and leave him with almost 340 000 pounds left in his pensions to then provide their discretionary income because Tim had been nervous about the stock market he had reduced the risk of their pensions to be invested in 40 stocks and 40 bonds if Tim then buys an annuity given the fact that this acts much like a bond it would make sense for him to sell bonds within his pension to pay for it leaving his overall exposure to the stock market unchanged but increasing the allocation of the remaining portfolio to 60 stocks and 40 bonds and as Tim said if his core expenditure is covered he would feel more confident taking a higher level of risk with a remaining portfolio the returns of an annuity are highly unlikely to beat the returns of the stock market but as we've seen in comparison with certain bonds they can be attractive and if we plug this into the original model we can see that this would significantly increase his chances of success as I said to Tim we can't draw too many conclusions from this model because this is just a simple tool that I've built for my subscribers to visualize their retirement plans but if you are interested in trying this out for yourself again you can find a link to this down in the description with this strategy we've used an annuity provide an income at the start of retirement but as an alternative Tim could set aside part of their pension say a hundred thousand pounds to be invested with the intention of buying an annuity later on in life at say 75 to provide them with a guaranteed income for the rest of their lives the advantages of this are that by 75 is likely one of them will have a medical condition which could significantly increase their annuity rate and given that this part of their pension then won't be needed for 18 years he can confidently invest that at a higher level of risk to achieve a higher return leaving Tim to focus on drawing down the rest of their pensions over a finite time frame which is much easier to manage if interest rates stay at this level or rise even further I can see annuities becoming useful for lots of people but even though they make a lot of sense on paper they get a lot of hate you see the thing that people really struggle with is that if you die early your funds are then you subsidize those that live for longer rather than going to your heirs in Tim's situation they had already helped their children get on the property ladder which means that their sole goal for their pensions is to provide them with an income in retirement and as far as he's concerned he already plans to use up all of these Assets in the pursuit of that objective what's more is that because he would have only annuitized part of their pensions there would still be plenty left over if they did happen to die early the reason why an annuity works so well for Tim is that it reduces the uncertainty of the future giving him one less thing to worry about but for that he has to sacrifice flexibility once that annuity is set up that's it he can't change it but for some people they hate the idea of this you know what if annuity rates rise in the future what if inflation Falls what if my expenditure changes there is a chance that you will regret this decision and this regret aversion pushes us away from annuities and towards options where we can change our minds like flexi access drawdown where you can invest your pension how you want and your income as you please the only irony is that this flexibility can leave you with so many options and choices and decisions to make that you become paralyzed unable to decide what to do so although an annuity is restrictive it also removes these choices so that you can crack on and enjoy your life the best solution is likely to be a combination of the two providing a base level of guaranteed income whilst giving you flexibility over the rest but I'm interested to hear what you think do you think that you'd ever consider buying an annuity and if so when please do let me know down in the comments now whether you plan on buying an annuity or not the big decision you need to make is when you're going to retire which is why you should now watch this video here where I explain why retiring in 2023 may be a big big mistake I'll see you there
