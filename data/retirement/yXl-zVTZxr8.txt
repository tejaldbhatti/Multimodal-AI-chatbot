in my last video we looked at an example of a couple who had just retired with six hundred thousand pounds in pensions invested in a portfolio of fifty percent stocks and fifty percent bonds and how they were looking to live off an income of forty thousand pounds a year we then use some software called timeline to stress test their plan by looking back in time to see whether this 40 000 pounds worth of income would have been sustainable if they had started the plan at any month over the last 100 years and as you can see the chances of success were pretty slim with only a six percent success rate so in only six percent of the 720 possible starting months over the last 100 years would they have been able to draw that level of income sustainably and as you can see here the only times this plan would have been sustainable is if they had started it in the 1920s or early 80s so all in all it wasn't looking great for them but through that video i went on to show you how you could get that plan to a 99 success rate by being flexible and making minor adjustments and the first adjustment that we looked at was changing their portfolio from 50 stocks and 50 bonds to 100 stocks and immediately they were up to a 27 success rate that's 4.5 times higher than they were before so we've increased the risk of their portfolio by having a higher allocation to stocks but somehow we've also increased their chances of success which is pretty counter-intuitive we're all taught that you should be decreasing risk as you get closer to retirement by increasing our allocation to bonds well in this video i'm going to show you that for many of you that's the worst thing you could possibly do and how if you put the right protections in place increasing the risk of your portfolio can dramatically decrease your risk of running out of money in retirement but with that said this strategy is not for everyone but with this video i want to make sure that the reason why you're choosing not to implement this is the right one and not just because you don't understand what's actually going on so let's get into it [Music] hello and welcome back to the channel for those of you that are new here hi my name is james i am a financial planner and this is a place where you can learn to make smarter financial decisions now we're going to be using the uk as a proxy for investing in general to help you understand why taking risk is not as risky as you might think here we're looking at how four different types of uk investment have performed over the last 25 years in red we have the total return of the uk stock market so the ftse all share in blue we have the total return of uk government bonds in green we have the retail price index so inflation and in yellow we have a proxy for the level of interest that you could get on a savings account if we first look at the green and yellow lines what this is showing us is that inflation has been running at a higher rate than the return available on cash in the bank so that now your cash will buy you 20 less goods than it did in 1995. so take away number one and this is really important unless you already have enough cash in the bank to fund all of your future needs in retirement then clearly keeping your money in the bank is only going to guarantee that you run out of money so unfortunately for most of us to achieve our goals and our income needs we are going to need some growth and to get growth we are going to need to take some risks but this should not be a strange concept because we all take risks in life and for those risks we expect some return getting into a car is a risk taking a vaccine is a risk going on a date is a risk and the larger the risks that we take the higher return we expect and the same is true of investing so going back to our chart if we need more growth and we need to take more risk we have two options we can either invest in stocks which is red or we can invest in bonds which is blue and as you can see over the last 25 years investors that have taken more risk by investing in stocks have been rewarded by higher returns but what do we mean by more risk well the journey for a stocks and shares investor has not exactly been easy in fact they would have had to have sat through three of the worst stock market crashes in history in 2000 after the dot-com bubble they would have had to have sat through three years of the market grinding lower and lower in 2008 they would have had to have held on whilst the whole financial system itself was melting down and in march 2020 well we all know what happened there whilst an investor in bonds would have had a pretty smooth journey but let's just think about that for a second if someone did invest in the ftse all share in 1995 was there ever any real risk of them losing their money well for them to have lost all their money it would have meant that all the listed companies in the uk would have had to have gone bust and for that to have happened then it would mean that we'd either been hit by a meteor or we'd become communists and clearly if either of those things happened then we'd have much bigger problems to worry about than what's going on in the stock market so when you're investing like this in a diversified index fund yes it's likely to be more volatile in the short term and that's why we say it's more risky but the only way that you can actually lose money is if you sell when the market is down and there's only two reasons that people ever do this the first is because they panic they take on too much risk than they can handle and when the market suddenly gets volatile when it starts dropping they panic and they sell and the second reason is that they simply haven't done their cash flow planning properly and they need the money to fund expenses if you're 40 years old this will not be a problem because you won't need this money for at least 15 years anyway but if you're 55 and retired well you need this money now or do you let's say you're 55 and you've built up a good retirement pot do you need all of this money right now no over the next five years to get you to 60 you're only going to need a small portion of it and then to get to 65 and 75 and onwards in fact the majority of your assets have an investment horizon that is far longer than you might think and if you want to leave any money to your kids well you get the point so how should we be thinking about this should we still be investing exactly as we were before in 100 stocks no because if the market crashes we're going to be forced to sell because we need the money to fund our lifestyle over the next five years well we know that even with the worst stock market crashes the market typically recovers within five years so what if we just kept five years worth of income as cash and then just started to eat into that if the market crashed how likely is it then that we would ever be forced to sell when the market is down very low and now that we've insulated ourselves from short-term market movements it means we can keep investing at the highest level of risk that we can tolerate and as a result we should expect to see higher growth and be able to sustain a higher level of income in reality and just as i showed in my last video we could be even more tactical than this and if the market does fall instead of just not selling anything for five years we could just sell a reduced amount and potentially even lower our expenditure which would allow us to keep a smaller cash buffer potentially only three years worth which would again leave more assets invested so that we can achieve a higher level of growth so what are the key takeaways from this if you do not already have enough cash to fund all of your future expenses then keeping money in the bank is only going to guarantee that you run out of money so if you need more growth you are going to have to take more risk and although investing is risky the risk of you running out of money is actually far higher if you don't take enough of it but when using index funds the only way that you can actually lose money is if you are forced to sell when the market is down and that only ever happens if you panic or you haven't done your cash flow planning properly now if you're a long way off retirement then cash flow planning should be easy and if you're in retirement then cash flow planning should also be easy and with this in mind you should be taking as much risk as you can tolerate in fact the only difficult thing about this is working out what that level is so the three simple steps that you need to follow to maximize your income in retirement is number one understand that investing is not risky number two with that in mind work out how much short-term volatility you can tolerate number three get good at cash flow planning and number four you need to watch this video here because in it i tell you everything that you need to know about inflation and how you can prevent it eating into your retirement income
