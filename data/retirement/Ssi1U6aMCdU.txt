I have three tasks for you to complete and I've built three sets of tools to help you do it these are the three Financial tasks that I do at the start of every year and if you can complete them and I say if because it is going to require some effort not only are you going to feel much more confident about your ability to achieve your financial goals in the future but you'll also feel much more fulfilled with your life today hello and welcome back to the channel if you're new here hi my name is James I am a financial planner and this is a place where you can learn to make smarter financial decisions planning for retirement is something that tends to get put on the back burner because retirement seems like an event that is a million miles away and when you've got a million other things that are demanding your attention it's easy to Kick the Can down the road but just like going to the dentist the longer you put it off the more painful it's going to be to correct as with everything the hardest part is getting started and taking that first step so I want to make that easy for you by showing you the three tasks that I would do to get started not just to get started these are the tasks that I continue to complete complete every year to ensure that my financial plan is on track so let's get stuck into the first one if you've ever used my retirement planning spreadsheet or built your own ret model you will know how changing the variables even slightly can dramatically affect the outcomes of the plan whether we assume an average and return of 5% or 6% can make a huge difference over time as one of you put it at 7.5% I have a legacy that lasts forever but at certain lower values I die alone in a ditch at the age of 71 and it's the same with spending the difference between spending 40 Grand a year in retirement or 45 Grand can be enormous the whole point of financial planning the reason that we build these models is to help us explore what our lives might look like in the future to explore the changes that we could make and the different ways that we could live and ultimately get ourselves into a position where we feel confident enough to act on that and make significant change perhaps that's in retiring early a career change deciding to send your child to private school or feeling confident to spend more money or to give it away these are all big life decisions that will drastically improve your life or the lives of others but for you to feel confident enough to actually take action you're going to have to have a lot of confidence in the data that you're using to make those decisions any financial model is only ever as good as the assumptions that it's based on and for retirement planning the two big assumptions are investment returns and what you're going to spend we don't know what investment returns we will see in the future but we do have hundreds of of years of historical data to guide us and we can do back tests in Monte Carlo analysis to stress test our plans against thousands of different return scenarios but when it comes to how much you're going to spend how much you're going to need to sustain the quality of life that you're looking for there is no historical data that we can fall back on that data needs to come from you there have been many times where I'm working with a client showing them a financial plan a model that has been stress tested against thousands of different returns scenarios a model that suggests that they should easily be able to afford to retire right now or to make that career change and yet they don't feel confident enough to do it because now when finally faced with making a decision they realize that they're not so confident about the assumptions that we've used specifically how much they want to spend whereas I have other clients who've taken the time to really think about this clients that have been tracking their expenditure closely they know where their money goes each month they know what they like to spend money on and the split between their fixed costs and discretionary spend and what they can Flex if they need to and by tracking this over time they even know their personal rate of inflation based on the goods and services that they like to use because they have absolute confidence in this data the data that we're building their plan on top of it then gives them the confidence to actually act on the results and make those meaningful changes in their lives a financial plan is only ever as good as the assumptions that it's based on which is why understanding your expenditure is the starting point for any good financial plan so to make this easy for you I have created a template that you can use to break down your spending and get clarity on where your hard earned money is going each month if you can do this and do it well not only will you feel more confident planning for the future but it will enable you to better allocate your money today I complete this template once a year with my wife we order a takeaway sit down and go through it and it really doesn't take that long once you've done it once it allows us to have a top- down perspective on what we're spending so that we can make sure that we're allocating our money in a way that aligns with our values and the goals that we want to achieve as an example we've just finished our most recent update and we noticed that we're barely spending anything on our health investing in our health is something that is important to us something that we know will pay dividends in the future but we've been really struggling to keep healthy ever since our son was born in August last year but this exercise gave us the perspective to recognize that we should probably be investing at least 10% of our disposable income in our health it's important to us and that's the figure that felt right and the way that this would work is that we then have a budget that we have to spend on health each year but it could be anything he related could be physio mental health getting a new office chair for my back personal trainer but for us there was one thing that really stood out there is this incredible family orientated Sports Club that's literally 50 m from our front door that we've been tempted by in the past but I've always just dismissed the idea because it would cost a lot of money it still does cost a lot of money but when I zoom out and think about our goals think about the things that are important to us in life it's actually not far off that 10% budget that we decided to invest in our health I am very guilty of this of turning my nose up at things just because it costs money but this annual exercise helps me to see the bigger picture it helps me to recognize that money is there to be spent whether now or in the future it needs to be spent and I'm already doing a lot for our future this process helps me to recognize that fact and to actually feel good spending money on things that align with our goals and our values and to fund this yes we decided to slightly reduce the amount that we're investing each month but we also took a look at our other discretionary items to see if there was something less valuable that we could swap out and we decided to reduce the number of times our cleaner comes each month for us we thought that the value that this membership would bring was higher than that of a cleaner and the fact that this membership also comes with two hours of free child care a day means that we'd actually have more time to do things around the house we all have different values we have different goals but this is a great example of how the same amount of money spent on two different things can give us different returns can give us different levels of fulfillment being conscious and decisive of how you're allocating your Capital can not only help you to plan for the future and be confident making those big life decisions but it will also help you to improve your quality of life today understanding your expenditure is the first step of working out how much you need to retire once you have this you can make better assumptions about how much you'll need to sustain yourself in retirement and if you know that you can work back from there to work out what level of assets you need to accumulate to do this you could use the 4% rule or something more sophisticated but let's say that you end up with a target of having Â£500,000 at the point of retirement the next step is to then work out how much you're going to need to save each month to hit that Target now this is the second task that I want you to complete and again I have built a tool to help you do this you enter the current value of your Investments the target you want to hit when you want to hit it and a projected investment growth rate and it will show you how much you need to save each month to achieve that goal along with other views that let you see how changing the size or date of your goal affects the amount you need to save again as you play around with this calculator you'll notice that the level of return that you assume makes makes a big difference to the end result which shows why it's so important to make sure that your money is invested properly and working hard for you which brings us on to the third task if I asked you how well your Investments are doing what would you say most people would answer that question by saying good or bad depending on whether their Investments are up or not recently but performance does not mean anything unless you have a benchmark to compare it with people often think their Investments are doing well but that's only because they have no idea what good looks like here's an example of a Scottish widows pension fund that I assessed for a client recently it was up 45% over the last 5 years which he was pretty happy with until I showed him what I think good looks like for that level of risk that's a 25% difference over just 5 years and that could mean the difference between retiring at 55 or 60 as I have said many times before you should never rely on past performance on its own to make investment choices but using appropriate benchmarks can help us to recognize when things are off track so we know that we need to investigate further find out why and decide whether we need to make a change but benchmarking your own performance can be hard not only because it's hard to know which benchmarks to use but when it comes to things like workplace pensions they make it very hard for you to find out what you're actually invested in and how it's performed to help you solve both of these problems I've put together a series of globally Diversified benchmarks that I think represent what good looks like each one relates to a different level of risk there's % stocks then 80% stocks 20% bonds 60/40 and 4060 and I've put their performance data updated to the end of last year into a document that you will find in the description along with a step-by-step guide to help you find out how you're invested what your performance has been and how you can assess if you need to make any changes if you are interested in using these benchmarks and this guide I would highly recommend watching this video here where I talk through them in more detail and explain how to decide which one to use I'll see you there
