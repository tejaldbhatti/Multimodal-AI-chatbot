the single biggest fear for any retiree is a stock market crash up until the point you retire crashes probably didn't bother you that much because you knew that you had time on your side to wait for the market to come back as it has done every single time but if you're retired or if you're about to retire you don't have time to wait and a stock market crash can be fatal i know that right now a lot of you are concerned about what's going on in ukraine and the heightened chances of a stock market crash so in this video i'm going to show you a systematic process you can put in place to reduce stress and keep your retirement plans on track [Music] hello and welcome back to the channel if you're new here hi my name is james i'm a financial planner and this is a place where you can learn to make smarter financial decisions before we dive into the solutions to alleviate your stress i want to show you some examples of just how devastating market crashes can be in retirement here we have fred and lucy they are both 55 years old and between them they've built up an impressive haul of 450k in pensions fred has been trying to work out if he can afford to retire and he's been doing some calculations he knows that the stock market has on average produced returns of nine percent per year which would equate to a pretty comfortable income of 36k a year now this would be ideal but he knows that he needs to take into consideration things like inflation and he wants to be conservative so he's going to reduce that income target down to five percent which would give him an income of 22 500 pounds a year and he's pretty comfortable with that so he's decided to retire but when we back test this plan against the last 100 years of historical market data you can see that this plan would have actually only been successful in 76 of scenarios a five percent withdrawal rate may sound conservative but it actually gives you a one in four chance of running out of money because we need to remember that stock markets do not move in straight lines they are extremely volatile and we can have years of phenomenal returns followed by lost decades this can of course work in your favor and although in 24 of these historical scenarios they would have run out of money in 30 percent they would have ended up with more than 1.5 million pounds left over and that's adjusted for inflation but surely over any 50 year period as we're testing here we should get a pretty equal measure of good returns and bad returns and over that long period of time they should average out so what then is creating the difference between the scenarios that end up at the top here and the ones that end up running out of money well it has everything to do with the sequence of these returns if fred and lucy retired today and they were lucky enough to then go on and see the same sequence of returns that we've seen over the last 10 years even though they would have been drawing an income through that period their portfolio would have actually grown in size to almost a million pounds and by that point they would be so far ahead of their goals that they never really need to worry about stock market crashes ever again and that's what happens with the scenarios that end up here but if they'd retired and immediately saw a bad sequence of returns like if they'd retired in 2000 just before the dot-com bubble burst after 10 years so by 2010 they would only have had 200 000 pounds left over and by this point they're then so far behind that even if they did then go on to see that following 10 years of phenomenal returns up until 2020 they would never have been able to catch up in the industry this is known as sequencing risk and what's worse is that no one can predict what sequence of returns we are going to see so we have two options we can either try and increase our chances of success by working longer and accumulating more assets and then just praying that we don't die before we get to enjoy them or we accept that there will always be some risk and if we do get unlucky we're just going to have to be pragmatic and make some changes i think the solution lies somewhere between these two and instead of trying to eliminate risks entirely and working ourselves into the ground we should first try and understand the tactical changes that we can make if we do get unlucky and we do see a bad sequence of returns and that's what the rest of this video is going to cover what to do if you find yourself in one of these situations so step number one don't panic and stick to the plan you need to remember that one year of bad returns is not going to move the needle much over a 40-year retirement and you need to avoid any knee-jerk reactions or an urge to try and time the markets to do this you should schedule a specific time each year when you review your retirement plan and only allow yourself to make changes to your portfolio at this time once a year is all you need there is no evidence that making changes to your portfolio more regularly than this adds any value in these reviews you have two tasks number one deciding how much income you need to draw and number two deciding what to sell well let's start with that second question because it's actually the easiest to answer most retirement portfolios have three key components an allocation to cash stocks and bonds the cash buffer is there to fund your short-term cash flow needs typically this ranges between two and four years worth of expenditure depending on how conservative you're being the stocks are there as the main drivers of growth within your portfolio whilst bonds act as a diversifier and help you avoid selling stocks when they're down so let's go back to that example of lucy and fred and let's say of their 450k that they've got in pensions 70 is invested in stocks 30 is invested in bonds and they also have an additional 50k cash buffer so they decide to retire and over the course of that first year they slowly start to eat into their cash buffer as they start spending money and when it comes round to our annual review we then need to replenish that over the course of that first year the different parts of fred and lucy's portfolio would have been growing at different rates and if it was a normal year we might expect stocks to grow faster than bonds now whether you're in retirement or not each year you should be rebalancing your portfolio back to its original weights we do this to prevent the risk of our portfolios drifting too high and it also forces us to sell high and buy low whilst we're rebalancing but in retirement instead of selling down stocks and using that cash to buy back bonds we take that cash and we use it to top up our cash buffer while simultaneously rebalancing our portfolio whereas if stocks had fallen in value over the year and bonds had outperformed we would then do the opposite and we would sell bonds so that we could top up our cash buffer and rebalance that allocation this is portfolio construction theory 101. it's super simple all you've got to do is stick to the plan but what's not so simple is working out how much income we should actually draw what if the markets have crashed should we be reducing our income and how much buy well fortunately there's lots of different strategies that we can use to help us work this out and today i'm going to be talking about one in particular that should help specifically in fred and lucy's situation in 2006 a financial planner called jonathan guyton developed a set of rules that could help retirees increase the amounts that they could sustainably withdraw from their portfolios while simultaneously preventing them from running out of money and he demonstrated that by employing this set of rules a retiree could reliably support a starting withdrawal rate as high as 5.4 in our example fred and lucy had a starting withdrawal rate of 5 or 22 500 pounds and each year thereafter they just adjusted this income in line with inflation and as we've seen that would have left them with a high chance of running out of money now they may get lucky and see a good sequence of returns and never have to worry about this but if they do see a bad sequence of returns then it makes sense that they're going to have to reduce their income and that's where guyton's rules come in he came up with two distinct rules that can be applied individually or at the same time the first rule is known as a guyton inflation adjustment and it says you should increase withdrawals each year in line with inflation except when the portfolio has fallen in value that year or if your withdrawal rate exceeds the original starting rate so if our portfolio had grown in value over the year we would carry on as usual and increase our withdrawals in line with inflation but if we saw the markets drop by let's say 25 percent we would keep withdrawals the same as they were the year before and then in the following year if the market went up 10 percent we would still need to hold back that inflation adjustment because the 22 500 pound withdrawal would equate to 6.06 of our current portfolio value which is higher than the five percent starting withdrawal rate now these inflation adjustments may seem small but if we add them into our back test look at what an enormous impact they make to fred and lucy's chances of success is absolutely massive most people assume that during stock market crashes retirees should be dramatically cutting their income but this often ends up just being extremely disruptive and actually has very little long-term benefit just think about it a 50 reduction in fred and lucy's income for the year would save them 11 250 pounds but by holding back an inflation adjustment of let's say 2.5 percent which they would barely even notice they would technically be reducing their income of all future years by 2.5 which means that over a 40-year period that would add up to a saving of 22 to 500 pounds but they would barely even notice which is why these types of small inflation adjustments are so much more effective now the second set of rules that guyton developed are known as guyton's guard rails these are much more drastic but they're also a lot more powerful although it's only recommended that you should use these during the first 15 years of retirement when you are most vulnerable and the rule goes if your current withdrawal rate has risen by more than 20 percent above the initial rate at which you started you should reduce your withdrawals by 10 fred and lucy were starting with a withdrawal rate of 5 so if at any time that rate then goes above six percent we would then know that we need to reduce our withdrawals by ten percent so as we saw before if in the first year the portfolio was to fall in value by 25 the current rate of withdrawal would then go up to 6.06 percent which would trigger this rule and let us know that we then need to reduce our income by 10 and there's also a corresponding rule that works on the upside in exactly the same way and if we apply these guard rails on their own to our back tested retirement plan you can see that they immediately push the success rate up to 99 which is as high as it goes these guard rails act just like the guard rails that you'd find in a bowling alley if you find yourself experiencing a poor sequence of returns and you end up drawing too much income they will systematically reduce that level of income until you get yourself back on track and then if you experience a sequence of good returns and you find that you're not drawing enough income it will then start to increase it the most painful part about stock market crashes is not knowing whether you're making the right decisions at the right time but if you've already predetermined when you're going to make those decisions and you have a process in place for making them then it makes stock market crashes so much easier to handle of course you're never going to be able to eliminate stress entirely especially as even with these rules in place a bad sequence of returns can still dramatically reduce your income but having a plan in place gives you much more time and space to focus on controlling your emotions which is by far and away the hardest part about investing and if you want to become a better investor you're gonna have to get better at controlling your emotions which is why you need to watch this video here where i show you the four key strategies for keeping your emotions in check i'll see you there
