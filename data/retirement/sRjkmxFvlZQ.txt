when you get to retirement you probably want to start creating an income right and you probably want to do this as passively as possible so that you've got time to travel the world terrorize the grandkids or lose yourself in a vr world but the question is what's the best way to go about creating a passive income well you may be thinking okay income may be dividends bonds high income funds maybe real estate investment trusts well no you'd be wrong hey guys welcome back to the channel so today we're going to be continuing our series looking at retirement planning and we're specifically going to be looking at busting one of the biggest myths there is when it comes to passive income now this video is going to be helpful for you whether you're 50 60 90 12 years old it doesn't matter because the information that you're going to learn in this video is going to affect the way that you construct your portfolio at whatever age you are in life so why does everybody get this wrong passive income i mean it's in the name income right but today i'm going to be showing you why if you're looking for income you should not be investing for income well at least not in the way that you're defining it as income from dividends property or income funds now i know this sounds really counter-intuitive but you're gonna have to bear with me on this one because i'm gonna show you step-by-step how i go about creating an income for my clients and it's not how you think so to start out we're going to have to go right back to the basics and the first thing that we're going to be looking at is dividends and why ultimately dividends are pretty much irrelevant when it comes to income so if you held two stocks company a and company b and they were both valued at a hundred pounds a share and then over the course of a year these two companies make a profit which equates to 10 pounds a share now if this happened we would expect their stock price to go up by 10 pounds now if company b then decides to pay that 10 pound profit out as a dividend to you we would expect that the stock price would also fall by the amount of the dividend so you would be left with a hundred pounds in stock and 10 pounds in cash from the dividend so if you were looking to create an income which two of these stocks do you think is gonna be best for you well you're probably thinking b right well what if you did have a portfolio that was entirely made up of a how would you go about creating an income from that well in reality you're not just going to own one share you're probably going to own lots and you could simply sell down some of those shares to release that profit and if you sold the right amount of shares you could ultimately end up with the equivalent of 100 pounds in stock and 10 pounds in cash so if i asked you again which one would you choose well you'd probably still say b because unlike a where you have to manually go in there and sell the shares with b the income is produced automatically but is that actually a good thing what if you received a 10-pound dividend but you only actually wanted eight well you then have to go and take that money and reinvest it and then you also have no control over when you actually receive these dividends and if it doesn't arrive when you need it then you're kind of stuffed or even worse what would happen if the dividend was reduced or even stopped completely just like what happened during the pandemic last year well i hope you're starting to see that although this income is produced automatically you're actually giving up control of a lot of the things that you need to be in control of especially as you also need to consider the tax implications of this income and the more control you have over what income you receive and when the better you are able to balance your tax liabilities between different tax types so that ultimately you end up paying less tax so if creating an income by selling shares is more efficient the dividends then do we really care about dividends well not really all we care about is whatever is going to produce us the best total return because we know that we can go in and sell down whatever we need when we need it but it's really important that we don't just then go and invest in growth stocks because if we did we would be constraining ourselves to only investing in a specific type of company and if we did that we would be decreasing the diversity of our portfolio which would ultimately result in us getting a lower total return over the long term but that would be exactly the same if we only focused on dividend paying stocks or equity income funds or property funds if we did this over the long term we would expect to see a lower return compared with a more diversified portfolio that was taking the same level of risk so the total return is all you should care about it is pretty much all you should ever care about but don't get me wrong dividends still form a very important part of that overall total return but we would rather that dividends got rolled up reinvested and kept on working for us so that we could then when we need to go back in and either sell units or shares to release cash we actually had a specific question about this last week i'm investing in vanguard life strategy and approaching retirement but they don't have an income option what should i do so to give this some context funds can come in two different types distribution funds which will automatically pay out any dividends or income that is received from the companies which are within the fund directly to your investment account or their accumulation funds which means that all the dividends and income automatically roll up and get reinvested in the stocks that the fund is invested in now vanguard has chosen to have all of its life strategy funds and retirement target funds as accumulation funds now one of the reasons why this is okay is because they realize that the most efficient way to create an income is to actually create it by going in and selling units as and when you need it so creating an income like this has a lot of big advantages firstly you're in control of how much you receive and when you receive it you also don't have to go about reinvesting dividends if you ever have a surplus you also get to choose exactly where you take your income from which means that you can balance this with other income sources to make sure that you are in the most optimum tax position so if you started receiving an income from a state pension you've got to balance the fact that that is income that's coming in it's going to be taxed as income tax so you might want to look at ways that you could release gains which are going to be charged as capital gains tax to balance that off and ultimately the most important thing of all of this is that this still gives you the freedom to invest in whatever you think is likely to produce you the best total return however there is one big downside and that's ultimately the fact that it's not really passive because you have to go in there and choose when to sell and what to sell and this can be really tricky if you're investing in individual companies and you've got a portfolio of 100 different companies you need to work out which ones are you going to sell down when but the reality is that most of you most people all of my clients are invested in funds and when you're only invested in a couple of funds it's actually pretty simple so the first thing that you're going to have to do is you're going to have to create a cash buffer so this could be between two and five years worth of expenses that you are going to sell down from your portfolio and you're going to keep it separate in some sort of savings account now the exact amount that you hold in this cash buffer is going to be personal to you and the things that you're going to need to consider is what other income sources have you got what is your attitude to risk what is the risk level in your portfolio and you know potentially whether you've got any debt obviously the more risky position you're in the bigger amount of cash buffer that you're probably going to want to have and then the idea is that you then start to pay yourself an income from that cash buffer now this depends on how you like to budget but this could be weekly it could be monthly i mean it could be every year if you wanted the idea is that it feels like you are receiving a salary which makes things easier to budget and the next part and the important part is how you then go about selling down your portfolio to replenish your cash buffer now there are various different ways that you can go about this but it's really important that the way that you choose is systematic and that you stick to the plan we find that often the best time to do this is actually to do it in tandem with when you rebalance your portfolio now i've talked about this several times before that if you are invested in a couple of different funds they are going to grow at different rates which ultimately means that over a period of time they're going to end up unbalanced so every six months every year whatever you say it's a good idea to go in and rebalance those funds by selling down some of the ones that have grown and buying back some of the ones that haven't and as part of this you could simply rebalance so that you also release a year's worth of income but you've also got to consider the tax implications of this because if you are selling something that said again you might be realizing a capital gain that you might have to pay tax on so although this is not strictly passive and you do have to do a little bit of work every year it's not exactly a big deal and it comes with a whole host of advantages so i hope this has helped you understand why the most efficient way to create an income does not actually involve investing for income it involves investing for the best total return which is ultimately what you're pretty much always doing but then artificially creating an income by selling things down as and when you need to but the question you've probably got in your minds is what happens when the market's full should you keep on selling or do you just start eating into your cash buffer well to ask that question we're going to have to dive into a lot of data but because i'm trying to keep these videos really short and concise we're going to do that in a separate video but in that video we're also going to be looking at safe withdrawal rate so that's how much you can sustainably withdraw from a portfolio without depleting it and i'm also going to show you some really interesting ways that you can maximize this sustainable figure simply by making changes to the amount of income that you withdraw depending on different market conditions but in the meantime if you're still looking to learn then check out this video here where i explain why i think right now is the best time to be investing
