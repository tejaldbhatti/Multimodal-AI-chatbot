compare cards by LendingTree conducted an online survey of more than 1 000 people and they found that 37 of people agreed with a statement that I have no idea how my credit score is determined and that's why I wanted to make this episode we're going to go over what a credit score is the different types of credit scores and some of its determining factors so let's go over what is a credit score a credit score is basically a summary of your credit history and it helps prove to lenders your ability to pay back the loan so as an example what if your good friend Sally needed to borrow money you guys have known each other since five years old you know she's normally good with her word and follows through and then she asks you for a hundred dollars and says she'll pay you back next month with interest you're more likely going to say yes to her than some random strain danger but banks are basically lending to strangers all the time they don't know you at all but they still lend money to people all the time and that's why they look at things like your credit score so if you have a credit history where you're always able to pay on time and in full like your credit card or mortgage payments you'll have a higher credit score and you're more likely to be approved for loans in the future if we go back to that scenario what if your good friend Sally never ends up paying you back you're probably not going to want to lend her another 100 in the future so it's the same thing with banks in this scenario she would likely have a lower credit score and future Banks would be cautious about lending her money again before credit scores Banks would just rely on their personal relationships with clients but now Banks can use credit scores to measure your reliability as a borrower and that matters more than personal relationships or reputation now it's important to have a good credit score because it will help determine whether you can get a mortgage a car loan or a student loan meanwhile if you have bad credit it'll be hard to get a credit card with a low interest rate and it'll cost us more to borrow money or you might even be denied for loans alright so now let's go over the range of a credit score so what is the range for a credit score well credit scores range from 300 which is poor to 850 which is excellent and I'm going to go over the different tiers of ranges with the two scoring models that I'll talk about later on the higher scores mean consistently good credit histories meaning on-time payments low credit utilization and a long credit history and then under 650 usually is considered problematic those with lower scores mean borrowers are riskier because of late payments or high credit utilization now if you have no accounts in credit history you would have a credit score of zero this would basically be the case for someone who's never had a credit card loan or any other form of credit if you don't have a score it's going to be hard to apply for credit as well now let's go over how your score is determined and first talk about the credit bureaus there are three major credit bureaus Equifax Experian and Transunion and they basically collect and maintain and credit information about you like your outstanding debts payment history and the length of your credit history this information is then compiled into credit reports so your credit score is calculated with a credit scoring model like FICO or Vantage score which analyzes the information on your credit report each of the three credit bureaus might have slightly different information about you so your credit scores from each Bureau might vary that's why it's important to check your credit reports from all three bureaus to make sure your information is correct now if you're curious about your credit report you can pull a free one yearly through annualcreditreport.com but also if you're signed up with smart credit which is a great tool to help you with boosting your credit they also have their smart credit report because it can be hard to read credit reports so their smart credit report lets you understand it a lot easier so I definitely recommend checking out smart credit they also offer three Bureau reports monthly which is included in the membership so if you were to get the three Bureau reports alone by itself elsewhere it's going to cost more than what smart credit costs without all the credit tools and features smart credit also has this feature called score boost that helps you add points fast in case you need to get a loan approved sooner than later you can move the dial to the amount you have for paying off your cards and the payment plan is going to adjust accordingly so you can see the best balance to pay off to gain the most points so go ahead and check out smart credit through the link below they have an offering right now for seven day free trial for just one dollar now let's get back to it so when you apply for credit many lenders follow a practice called try merge or middle score lending they'll basically pull credit scores from all three bureaus and use the middle score instead of the average so if the three scores differ the middle score is considered to be more reliable so for example if your credit scores are 710 from Equifax 730 from Experian and 740 from TransUnion the lender might use the 730 score to evaluate your credit application if they're doing the middle score lending practice so I briefly mentioned the two scoring models but now let's go over them so FICO Advantage score are the two different credit scoring models that calculate credit scores but even though they use similar factors to calculate scores they have slightly different methods and scoring ranges the FICO scoring model has been around since 1989 and was created by Fair Isaac and Company now called the fair Isaac Corporation FICO scores are more widely used by lenders and creditors in the US and in this article it mentions according to my FICO over 90 percent of top lenders use FICO credit scores to make lending decisions it's basically the industry standard like many banks credit card companies and mortgage lenders use FICO to decide who to lend to now with the FICO credit score ranges exceptional is 800 to 850. very good is 740 to 7.99 good is 670 to 739 fair is 580 to 669 and poor is 300 to 579 and FICO considers five factors in the calculation of your credit score which is payment history which is 35 amounts owed which is 30 length of credit history which is 15 credit mix which is 10 percent and new inquiries which is ten percent now let's talk about the Vantage score the Vantage score model on the other hand was started in 2006 by the three major credit bureaus Equifax Experian and Transunion as an alternative to FICO scores so over the years Vantage score has gained some traction and certain lenders credit monitoring services and personal finance websites use Vantage score to provide consumers with credit scores now the difference with FICO credit card balances and credit utilization are the most influential factors with FICO it's payment history so let's go over the credit score ranges for Vantage score excellent is 781 to 850. good is 661 to 780. with fare it's 601 to 660. hor is 500 to 600 and very poor is 300 to 4.99 so a person with a strong FICO score is probably going to have a good Vantage score especially since the differences between the two are pretty minor But ultimately the choice of which one to use depends on the lender's preference and their internal policy so you can't actually choose which one the lenders will use since FICO is the most common let's go into their five factors for calculating your FICO score so you can understand it more and know what you need to look out for so again 35 is payment history and that means how consistently you're making your payments on time it's the biggest contribution to your credit score so if you make sure you pay your bills on time you're already a third of the way there and if you're doing this with multiple cards it gives you more opportunities to demonstrate that you are a good and responsible borrower the key thing is to really make sure you are paying your bills on time and in full and if you have late payments the degree of that impact depends on factors like how late the payment was how often you've had late payments and the total amount of debt owed now usually payments more than 30 days past due will be recorded to credit bureaus and can stay on your credit report for up to seven years that's why it's very important to keep track of this and make sure you're organized and collection accounts judgments bankruptcies and tax liens can all severely Dam damage your credit score these items can remain on your credit report between usually seven to ten years now 30 percent of your credit score is going to be based on your amounts owed so having a high credit card balance will negatively impact your credit score because of the utilization ratio the credit utilization ratio is taken by dividing your total credit that you're using by the maximum that you're allowed to take so for example if you have a total credit card balance of two thousand dollars in a total credit limit of ten thousand dollars your credit utilization rate is going to be 20 and you get this number by dividing your 2000 by 10 000. it may indicate that you're relying heavily on credit or experiencing financial difficulties which makes you a high risk borrower High credit utilization can negatively impact your credit score a utilization ratio above 30 percent is seen as a negative to creditors so it's good to use less than thirty percent of your credit limit so here's some tips to increase your credit utilization you can pay off balances so you reduce the total credit you using you can also request a credit limit increase you also don't want to close unused accounts because it will decrease your total available credit which increases your credit utilization rate so you should continuously monitor this rate now let's go to the next Factor so 15 of your credit score is going to be determined by the length of your credit history and this reflects the age of your credit accounts and your experience managing credit over time so a longer credit history generally means a higher credit score because it provides data for lenders to evaluate your credit worthiness for credit cards the longer you've been borrowing and paying responsibly the better and this is why some people actually recommend adding their kids to a card because it helps them build their credit history by the time they're 18. for loans the sooner you get rid of them the better so here's a breakdown of how length of credit history impacts your credit score one is the age of oldest account so a longer credit history with a good payment record shows you have experience handling credit responsibly so it's best to keep your old account still open and then age of newest account is another one when you open new credit cards it's going to be classified as new accounts which will affect your credit history but this impact usually decreases over time when you show a positive payment history with the new accounts next is average age of accounts the average age of all your credit accounts is calculated by adding the ages of each account and dividing by the total number of counts a higher average age indicates a longer and more stable credit history which is viewed favorably by lenders all right going back to what determines your credit score 10 is credit mix so credit mix refers to the variety of credit accounts you have it's good to have a mix of revolving credit which is like credit cards and lines of credit and installment loans which include mortgages auto loans and personal loans so lenders like to see you can handle different types of credit accounts and that you're not overly reliant on one form of borrowing it's not required to have a ton of different accounts as it's just 10 of your score but your score could increase if you responsibly use different types of credit so when I'm saying this I'm saying don't deliberately just open lines of credit to try to boost your score you should only do it if you have to and then the last 10 percent is new inquiries and we kind of mentioned this earlier but new credit inquiries refer to the number of times you've applied for new credit which usually results in hard inquiries on your credit report and these hard inquiries assess your credit risk when you apply for a loan credit card or other types of credit on the other hand there are also soft inquiries and the soft inquiry happens when you receive an offer from A lender like a pre-approved credit card when you check your own credit so basically with soft inquiries a company reviews your credit information for reasons other than evaluating your credit worthiness or a loan or credit extension so this doesn't drop your credit score but hard inquiries can negatively affect your score and each inquiry can stay on your report up to two years but it affects most people's score by less than five points so don't apply for new credit unless you really need it as an exception though if you're shopping around for a loan like a mortgage car loan or student loan then should only count as one hard inquiry if you do it within a 14 to 45 day window so as an example maybe you're shopping for a mortgage and you inquire with three different lenders your score should only decrease once during the shopping window instead of three times all right I hope this was a helpful breakdown of a credit score I went through the different scoring models how your credit score is determined and different things you can do to help boost your credit score I definitely recommend checking out smart credit it's a great tool it makes it easy
