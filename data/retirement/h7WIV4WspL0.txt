how much do I need to retire this is one of the most searched questions on the internet but the irony is that there is no answer to this question because no one knows what will happen in the future what will happen with inflation the stock market what support will my family need how long will I live the lack of answers to these questions leaves many people Paralyzed by fear a fear that keeps them working much longer than they need to when you first start working you're young and healthy and have an abundance of time that you're more than willing to trade for money and as you progress through life making this trade and building assets you'll eventually get to a point where your time and health become the most scarce resources but in the face of all these unknowns people continue to make this trade for much longer than they need to often until someone Close to You Falls ill or dies and forces you to wake up to your own mortality but if the future is so uncertain how can we have any confidence that we have reached this point well the answer is flexibility accept the fact that you will never be able to plan for everything and build flexibility in your plan to handle whatever life throws at you and in this video I'm going to show you how by understanding your options and being flexible you can retire much earlier and with more confidence than you would have ever thought possible hello and welcome back to the channel if you're new here hi my name is James I am a financial planner and it is my job to help people prepare for and navigate through retirement the four percent rule is the most widely used tool for gauging whether you have reached that critical point and have built up enough assets to retire it was developed by Bill bengan back in 1994 based on an analysis of historical stock markets data and it states that if you retire with an Investment Portfolio of a hundred thousand pounds you should be able to drop four thousand pounds each year whilst ingesting for inflation and even in the worst of scenario is this should still be sustainable going by this if you wanted an income of twenty thousand pounds a year you would need a portfolio of 500 000 pounds and if you wanted 40K you'd need a million I like this rule because in the face of all this uncertainty it gives us a simple figure that we can use as a North star to guide us on our journey but what I don't like is the fact that this rule suggests that there is only one way to solve this problem save more money save a lot more money I mean I don't know about you but a million pounds for 40 Grand a year sounds like a hell of a lot of money when in reality you can confidently retire with way less than this so long as you are willing to be flexible and adapt if you need to and by understanding the different ways that you can go about solving this problem and just how flexible you can be you'll be much more confident in your ability to adapt to whatever life throws at you let me demonstrate with an example Fred and Rosie are both 47 years old Fred currently has 175 000 pounds in his pension and is contributing ten thousand pounds a year Rosie has a pension of 80 000 pounds but is no longer working and they also have 50 000 pounds in Isis each of these accounts is invested in a globally Diversified portfolio of 80 stocks and 20 bonds and their goal is to retire at 55 with a net retirement income of forty thousand pounds per year with a four percent rule this would require them to have a one million pound Investment Portfolio so over the next eight years until retirement their Investments are going to have to grow a lot and what are the chances of that well no one knows what will happen in the future but to give us a guide we can use some software that I often use with my clients to look back in history and back test this plan against the last 100 years of stock market data to see just how successful they would have been and if I enter Fred and Rosie's details into this these are the results it doesn't look good the solid Blue Line represents the median scenario which has their assets growing from 300 000 pounds up to a peak of 650k at retirement and then once they start drawing an income it slowly depletes until they run out of money at age 79. although in some scenarios they would have got more lucky with this lighter Blue Line representing the 10th percentile which has their assets peaking at 820 000 pounds before eventually running out in their 90s this view here gives us more insight into the historical data that underpins this model demonstrating the highest levels of sustainable income that could have been drawn if this plan had been started at any month over the last 100 years and we can see that only in a handful of scenarios from the 1920s would they have been able to draw more than forty thousand pounds sustainably so yes they might get lucky and this plan might work but we don't go into this type of planning expecting to be lucky it's the downside scenarios that we care about which is also why the x-axis goes all the way up to 101 as between them they actually have a 1 in 10 chance of reaching that H which is a downside scenario that we need to plan for this score up here shows us that in only seven percent of historical scenarios would this plan have been successful whilst in 93 it would have failed which is not surprising given that the four percent rule suggests that we need a million but this is where the four percent rule starts to fall down firstly the rule does not take into consideration State pensions and fret is set to get a full State Pension whilst Rosie is set to get a third of it and when we Factor these into the plan we can see that the success rate jumps up to 43 percent with the median scenario lasting into their 90s with this there are many more scenarios in which they could have executed this plan without a problem in fact in 30 of these scenarios they would have ended up with more than 600 grand left over but as I said if we get lucky we get lucky the upside scenarios will take care of themselves but it's this 57 of failures that we need to focus on and assess what we could do to make them work if we need to as you are about to see there are so many different levels that we can pull to solve this problem and finding the right level will depend on your own individual preferences so as we go through each of these options I want you to think about them in the context of your own situation and ask yourself which of these compromises would you rather make firstly if between now and 55 Fred and Rosie experience a poor sequence of returns and start to lag behind Fred could simply work for a bit longer if he worked for just one more year the success rate jumps up to 60 two more years it jumps to seventy percent three seventy four percent and if you worked until 61 well then we'd get into the 90 range which is where most people start to feel comfortable but what if Fred absolutely loads his current job and can't stand the thought of having to work for another six years well as an alternative instead of retiring completely at 55 he could instead find some more sustainable part-time work that fits around his lifestyle and if between the two of them they could earn an extra thirty thousand pounds a year between 55 and 65 they could increase their chances of success to 90 percent but perhaps they think that 30 000 pounds is too much of a stretch and they're both desperate to stop working entirely well as another alternative they could downsize at some point in the future and to make this work if they downsized at 65 they would need to release 300 000 pounds of equity from their home for many people that would be a pretty hefty downsize so if that's not possible and they don't like any of the other options they might just have to reduce their retirement income if they reduced it from forty thousand pounds to 35k the success rate would jump up to 71 down to 30k and it's up to 84 percent and with 27 000 pounds a year they would get to 90 when thinking about each of these options in the context of your own situation there are probably some that seem more realistic than others perhaps you enjoy work and you love where you live so working those extra six years until 61 is a much better trade than having to move home or perhaps your career enables you to go part-time more easily or maybe you have a side gig or hobby that you can see yourself making income from in retirement the the first thing to realize is that there is no single right answer it all depends on your own individual preferences and the second is that you'll only be able to decide which is the best option for you once you have laid them all out on the table in front of you if you were just using the four percent rule you might think that the only option is to save more money or to reduce income in retirement when actually there are so many ways to solve this problem many of which we haven't even looked at here and what's more is that you don't need to choose just one you can do a bit of everything as an example to make this work Fred could work until 57 then from 57 until 60 work part-time earning twenty thousand pounds per year and then finally at 65 downsize and release 150 000 pounds worth of equity from their home if you understand the options that are available to you you can mix and match them to find a balance that fits despite all of this historical data we still have no idea what will actually happen in the future but by going through this process and understanding the different ways that we can adapt if we need to we can get comfortable with our ability to handle whatever life throws at us even though Fred and Rosie don't have to make any decisions right now by exploring the paths that they would prefer to go down if they need to they can start preparing for it if Fred thinks he would prefer to work part-time in a more sustainable job that fits into his lifestyle then he can start researching his options and developing the skills he needs to make that change in the future or if downsizing is on the cards they can start preparing their house for sale and doing work to add value to it or they could even look at taking Equity out of their home ahead of time and investing that elsewhere knowing that they'll be able to pay off that mortgage when they come to sell the house the future is uncertain and no amount of planning will be able to eliminate that entirely but by focusing on the things that you can control and the options that you have you'll feel much more confident in your ability to adapt to whatever life throws at you now unfortunately the software that you've seen in this video is quite expensive and only really available to financial advisors but in this this video here I introduce you to a linear cash flow model that I have built that you can plug your own
