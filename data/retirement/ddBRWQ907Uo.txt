what do you want when you retire you want an income you want it to be sustainable even in the face of inflation and you want that income to be as passive as possible so you can spend your time doing whatever it is you want to do enter dividend investing a strategy that can yield you an income of between 4 and 6% per year that's money that's paid into your account on a quarterly basis with no action needed from you and given that you're investing in profitable businesses that can increase their prices that yield is likely to be very resistant to inflation dividend investing is not only good for income it has also produced phenomenal total Returns the S&P 500 dividend Aristocrats is a group of American companies that have increased their dividend every year for the last 25 years and as you can see here over the short term whilst the S&P 500 has been plummeting the aristocrats have held their ground and if we go back to 2007 we can see that whilst the S&P 500 has returned 275% the aristocrats returned 390 per. what is not to love this strategy appears to be the retirees dream but I would never recommend this to any of my clients because dividend investing is an extremely lazy and inefficient strategy that appeals to our insecurities and biases and in this video I'm going to show you why that is and what you should be doing instead [Music] hello and welcome back to the channel if you're new here hi my name is James I am a financial planner and this is a place where you can learn to make smarter financial decisions dividend investing is extremely popular and it's easy to see why you get a passive income it's sustainable and in the past it has produced Market beating returns and I expect it to continue to do so in the future so why then do I and fellow financial planners like Ben Felix advise our clients not to do this well let's start with the Basics and explain why Dividends are not the free money people think they are here we have two companies company a and Company B they are identical in every way they have the same assets revenue and expected future earnings the only difference is that company a has a policy of paying a high dividend typically around 5% given this information as a Rari who is looking for income which company would you rather invest in Well Company a is giving you a 5% income whil Company B isn't giving you anything it's got to be a right wrong let me explain let's say each company owns assets worth $100 per share and to make things simple let's assume that the share price matches the book value of those assets at $100 per share over the course of the next year each company makes profits or earnings to the tune of $10 per share which increases the company's assets to $110 per share Company B decides to to reinvest those profits back into its business whilst company a decides to pay out a dividend of $5 per share and once that dividend is paid what do you think would happen to its share price Well Company B still has assets worth $110 whil company a only has 105 this is the bit that people fail to recognize when a company pays a dividend it is returning cash to investors therefore its assets and share price will fall by the amount of the dividend in reality when looking at a company's share price it can be very hard to see this happening because there are so many other factors that influence a share price on a given day and even though a company may be paying a 5% annual dividend they often pay that out in quarterly installments so the daily movement may only be 1.25% which is easily obscured by the normal volatility of the share price Dividends are not free money the company is simply deciding to return your Capital to you rather than keep it invested it has the same effect as if the company directors had decided to sell some of your shares and return them to you because if you owned shares in Company B and wanted an income of $5 you could create a homegrown dividend by selling down some of your shares to leave you with the equivalent of $105 worth of stock and $5 of cash so let me ask you that question again if you're looking for an income which of these companies would you rather invest in as you can see it's irrelevant whether a company pays a dividend or not we should value $5 of dividends exactly the same as $5 from a capital gain but we don't part of us still prefers dividends even though they're not as efficient you see with a dividend your income is dictated by a group of company Executives that have absolutely no regard for your financial plan whilst with homegrown dividends you have control and can take the exact amount that you need when you need it yes there may be trading costs involved but it's also likely to be much more tax efficient generally in most countries Dividends are taxed at higher rates than capital gains if you're in the UK you probably invest through taxfree rappers like pensions or Isis so you might not think that you need to worry about tax but that's not quite true because there is one tax that these rappers can't protect you from if you receive a dividend from a foreign company you often receive that dividend net of a withholding tax if for an example you are based in the UK investing in US Stocks any dividends that you receive will be paid net of a 30% with holding tax even if you are invested in a pension or an Isa however this rate does drop to 15% if you have signed a W8 Ben form from your broker so as a side note the next time you get an email from your broker bugging you to sign this get on it whichever way you look at it Dividends are a very inefficient way of generating an income and any rational investor should prefer homemade dividends where you can sell down assets exactly as you need them this is the rational thing to do but barely anyone does in a fascinating piece of research called the decumulation Paradox why aren't retirees spending more they studied the draw down strategies of us-based retirees and they found that across all wealth levels 58% of retirees draw down less than the income that their Investments generate 26% draw the exact amount of income that their portfolios earn whilst only 14% draw down on the capital so in any given year only one in seven retirees are actually selling down their assets to fund retirement the rest are just living off the income it's impossible to say what exactly is causing retirees to behave like this but the research has concluded that instead of taking a top-down approach where you work out how how much money you need to sustain your quality of life and then create a dynamic strategy to fund that retirees are taking a bottomup approach by first identifying their guaranteed and steady income sources and then just adjusting their Lifestyles to fit within that budget this is not a rational approach to retirement planning and you'll probably end up working for way longer than you need to trying to supplement your income and then Waste Your Precious healthy retirement years being Frugal when you should instead be enjoying your money to a rational investor the income a portfolio generates is irrelevant the only thing that matters is the total return that is delivered by dividends and capital gains and although dividends used to provide a very significant portion of the stock market's Total return 67% in the 1940s 44% in the 1960s and 73% in the 1970s in recent decades dividends now only make up a very small proportion of that overall total return with a majority now being driven by capital gains Dividends are irrelevant but to the vast majority of investors income is everything so why are we so biased why are we programmed to think that company a is superior to Company B well as with most investing mistakes it's all in your head mental accounting is a phenomenon whereby we spend money that has come from different sources in different ways the classic example of this is how we often view bonuses or tax rebates as free money and spend them far more frivolously than money that we have earned through our normal salary if you got a 5k bonus you're likely to spend it in a very different way than if you got a 5k pay rise this is a rational our perspectives of money should not change depending on where it's come from and we also see mental Accounting in the way that we view income versus capital in our minds we have this Ledger with income on one side and capital on the other and we think that anything that falls into this income column can be spent freely whilst anything in this Capital column must never be touched we think that income will keep flowing as long as we don't touch the capital in a 2019 paper titled the dividend disconnect they coined this the free dividend fallacy where investors view dividends as free money and as a result value them more highly than capital gains to the extent where investors are willing to pay more for dividend stocks like company a even though there is no basis for doing so but why does this happen why do we value income more highly mainly because we're lazy with dividends money just gets paid into your account every quarter and you just then learn to live by that income but if you wanted to create an income from Capital you need to first work out how much income you need to sustain your lifestyle you then need to assess whether it's sustainable to draw that level of income given current market conditions you also need to decide what you're going to sell when you're going to sell it and when you finally do decide to sell you will no doubt kick yourself as the market goes up right afterwards it's a classic case of regret aversion and inertia bias we chimps will do anything to avoid regressing decisions so much so that we would rather not make any we would rather Outsource the decision making to somebody else even if that someone is a company executive who sets a dividend policy who couldn't care less about our financial plans I know this is true because I feel exactly the same way my inner chimp would much rather somebody else decide what income is sustainable and just pay that money into my account each month screw having to make all these decisions which I might get wrong and regret this is why we value dividends more highly than capital gains but as you now know there is no rational reason why you should prefer company a over Company B whoa whoa whoa chill out if Dividends are irrelevant then why is it that companies that pay higher dividends tend to outperform on a total return basis too good question and let me explain this one with an analogy did you know that cars that are painted red are likely to be faster and have more horsepower than cars that are painted blue or any other color for that matter so if this was all the information that I had and I was looking to buy a fast car it's understandable that I might think that I should looking for a red car right but anyone with any knowledge of cars knows that it's not the paint color that makes a car fast it just so happens that red is associated with a lot of sports car brands and favored by people that drive fast car so if I went on auto trader and picked a random red car yes it's likely that it would be faster than average but not all fast cars are red and not all red cars are fast so by filtering ing for just red cars I'm limiting myself to a small corner of the market and there's still a high chance that I could pick a dud instead I would have much more success if I filtered by the characteristics that actually contribute to a car's performance like perhaps its make or the size of its engine I hope you're starting to see my point historically companies that pay high dividends have outperformed companies that don't but the dividend is not the reason that these companies out perform just like the red paint Dividends are just a symptom of the underlying characteristics or factors that really lead to outperformance in a 2014 paper Eugene farmer and Kenneth French identified that over the long term companies with lower valuations compared with their Book price tend to outperform companies with high valuations smaller companies tend to outperform big companies more profitable companies tend to outperform less profitable ones and companies that invest conservatively tend to outperform ones that invest aggressively these are the actual factors that drive outperformance it just so happens that companies that are highly profitable and invest conservatively are more likely to pay a dividend and that dividend is going to look much higher if their valuations are low and farmer and French use their model to demonstrate that 95% of dividend stocks outperformance can be explained by their exposure to these factors so yes if you want to try and outperform the market you could build a portfolio entirely made up of dividend stocks but you would be restricting yourself to a small corner of the market which would reduce your diversification and leave you heavily exposed to certain sectors like finance and energy and underexposed to smaller companies a much more efficient way to do this would be to ignore dividends entirely and instead build a portfolio that selects for these factors in the first place this is known as Factor investing it's how I invest my money and my client's money and if it's something that you want to learn more about to decide whether it's something that's right for you then you should watch this video here I'll see you there
