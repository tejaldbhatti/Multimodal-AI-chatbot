you know on this show we talk about the aggregation of marginal gains and what we're really referring to is this idea of getting one percent better today we thought it's been four years we've actually talked about a lot of ways to get one percent better let's stack those together and make an episode welcome to the ultimate crowdsource personal finance show this is choose to find you're listening to

online [Music] foreign [Music] guys 100 ways to get one percent better and to help me with this I have my co-host Brad here with me today how you doing buddy hey Jonathan I'm doing quite well yeah this should be a lot of fun so we uh I guess would inspired this well there are two things that inspired us right it's uh the episode that just released episode 317 with our good buddy Chris Hutchins and we talked about all the hacks which is his new podcast which should be amazing and actually on our website we published exactly that 100 ways to get one percent better with your finances but really it's with your life and yeah I think you and I kind of talking through this concept like you said that that aggregation of marginal gains it sounds so kind of like hoity-toity right when you hear it like that but but it's really just looking for these little ways you can improve and when you're constantly trying to improve and especially as I see it it's like when you can invest just a little bit of time to fix something that then you're never going to have to invest that time again that to me is like the ultimate in this aggregation of marginal gains like Jonathan I used to It's Gonna sound so Antiquated I have file cabinets in my closet I know you have like no paper in your house but I have like it's ridiculous like literal file cabinets that are filled and I mean most of the stuff in there is years old but what I decided to do was all right a I need to join 2021 and turn anything that I'm getting paper statements or whatever that's got to stop immediately so I went through that took a lot of time but I shut them off and now I get emails you're talking about individual bills right that's where you're starting with so yeah wherever I could right so obviously like credit card bills yeah sorry if I wasn't clear enough credit card bills are not coming in the mail anymore there are PDFs right and I just saved those PDFs or the few bills that I can't get electronically when when they come into the house I scan them immediately so I don't have to think about it they don't pile up scan them is like a friction point I just want to like focus on that do you have like a dedicated scanner for this Allah some accountants do is there like something that you came up with because for me scanning is like all right how do I use the scanner you know does the software work on the printer like I'm curious about that yeah no for me it's just it's on my printer and I mean it takes it takes five seconds the PDF file gets sent over to my computer and then I have a folder a main folder where everything is saved and it's just it's incredibly easy like I have a digital file cabinet basically and what the cool aspect is I then take that sheet of paper and put it immediately in my shredder bin so it is gone it's not lying around you know we always joked about like I want this Oasis in my house you know I want it like I just don't want the psychic baggage of just seeing stuff lying around so like it feels so good to scan this thing and then just put it in the shredder bin it's fantastic so anyway I'm sure somebody out there but I'm sure you have a a better more high-tech version but like damn this is really working for me no you give me too much credit I wish I did I um I'm getting buried dude I'm getting buried someone was actually telling me like about this one company and I'll have to dig up the name I'll come back to it later on in this episode where you just bundle up all of your mail or you take all your mail you take a picture of it and send it to them and specifically you talk about the bills right so I'm talking more about the spam you know the the 12-week plum letter or whatever it is where you get all the special deals for XYZ uh shops it's just that plasticky type paper that shows up and they say you just take a picture of whatever that mailing is and they go on your behalf and they go unenroll you from all those things I think it was like I'm gonna look it up so don't hold me to this name but something like paper Karma something along those lines so you can have a company and it's it's not a huge subscription fee it is a SAS but you know I don't if SAS is the right word but it is a subscription cost but you know you imagine at some point you could probably just like use it while you're getting rid of the stuff and then once the stuff's gone I don't know if you need to like maintain it for a lifetime so it would seem to me like some combination of dialing in your system for your bills reducing the number you're getting taking pictures of the ones you need making it very easy to use the scanner knowing how to use the scanner and then on the other end of that for the spam I think there's some lists that you can go register like do not mail register list type deals we should look into that that would be that would be something I don't know and it does go to one percent better right I I don't even know if this was on our ultimate article list we might need to actually mail this but how can I decrease the amount of time that I have to spend handling the stuff that enters my mailbox get that time back it is worth something your time is worth something and it's worth more than you know fifteen dollars an hour even that's like a minimum threshold but let's not spend all of our time just trying to figure out how to get rid of spam all right dude well I think that actually points us if we were we mentioned the episode with Chris I think we should come back to that for just a half second because literally as soon as we finish the live call with Chris he mentioned to us a massive one that was tailored specifically towards you Brad but really our audience I know will will love this one as well it didn't make it into the episode I wanted to go ahead and share it now what what is the last hack that we would want to add on to that episode with Chris yeah this was a really cool one that that uh we just didn't have time to mention in in the last episode so it's uh it's as you said it's built around around your library but it's for the digital books so basically there's this extension that Chris uses and it's it's literally at library extension.com and it allows you to see the book availability from your local library I I have not installed this yet but Chris showed us a screenshot of it and it was really cool so Chris lives in the Bay Area and he was just shopping around showing us on on the screen at amazon.com and he was on just some random ebook and this extension added on that said San Francisco Public Library copies available and there was a check mark and then it just said borrow or place a hold and I mean it was amazing like it it overlay it on top of amazon.com so I don't know about you Jonathan but yeah I've been especially this past year just rocking the eBooks on my Kindle and it's kind of annoying to go to whatever it is overdrive or Libby and you just like randomly looking for books and it seems like invariably everything's everything's a wait list or hold whatever but it's pretty cool to just have that availability at amazon.com and just see it at a glance like book by book it was really cool right I mean literally as you're about to maybe purchase a book on Amazon you just notice that there's a copy available at your local library like that's a game changer it's just yeah it needs to be mentioned it's it's high value oh and that's brilliant because right because that's the behavior real side like I'm thinking in terms of somebody who uses the library right like my bias is to go to the library but what you're saying is even is even bigger than this which is okay hey you install this extension one time and then even if you're someone who would be inclined to just buy books reflexively if you're at Amazon and you see oh wow this is available at my library for the same one click and I saved money that I was literally going to spend like that's a no-brainer so yeah actually that's the better use case John yeah the psychological behavioral component that's it and let me just point this out like we have a publishing arm we publish books I like buying books and and I want you to buy books but but I also want you to use your library and get full value and let me give you a use case here for those of you like well what's the line there what I personally do is whenever possible I try to get the book at the library just personally I get the book of the library if I find myself wanting to renew it more than once or twice I'm like you know what I should probably just buy the book like this book was worth the price of admission it's one that I'm going to refer back to it's one that I want in my home I should own the book and that would be a use case so whatever possible use your library and to make it easier to get in front of your own um you know kind of Amazon behavioral analysis charts just have the extension law you're about to buy just notice it's right there oh my library has it maybe I'll just try there first and if it tells you it's a 45 week hold okay well you know maybe we'll just go and buy it but let's start there let's see what happens I mean that's big though dude I think that is one we wanted to start with that one because it was tied to our all the hacks episode but two it kind of gets us thinking about the library again you know ours reopened and we were able to go back it's pretty cool yeah that's funny Laura actually my wife Laura visited our local library a couple times this past week so yeah it's nice uh that was pretty much like the last thing that I'd seen that would had not reopened after covet so yeah it was that was kind of cool yeah as you said we are choose to fight we've always had the tagline Friends of the library that is a massive savings each year all right so we're gonna go through these lists we're just gonna pick a few of the items because they spark some conversations highly encourage you to go check out the full list 100 reasons it might be 100 and growing but uh 100 ways to get one percent better so Brad uh how can they access that article if they want to just get the full list there will be a link in the show notes but can we give them a direct URL as well yeah you bet and just for anybody who doesn't know basically how we do the show notes is just you go to our website show chooseify.com and then just the episode number so this episode is 318 so you just choose a vitacom 318 and that works for our entire catalog so back to you know the initial episodes zero zero one that'll take you there so that's really the easiest but yeah to your point Jonathan we did set up a short code just for this particular article so chooseify.com one percent so that's one the number one and then write out the word percent so choose a better com slash one percent all right so we are going to selectively pick these action items as they kind of stand out to Brad and myself probably once we're leaning into in a big way these days but you know you might have a different priority list than us so don't limit yourself to what we talk about on this show I'm going to start Brad with uh number three you can jump ahead of me if you want to reading or listening to because it's related reading or listening to One new Finance or investing book each month now I want to expand outside of that I would actually change this slightly I would just say reading or listening to One non-fiction book each month one book that improves you in some way so non-fiction isn't it could be a fiction book but it it scales your knowledge base it scales the information that you have to work with in some way so is it investing is it personal finance is it development you know self-development and I would even scale outside of a book and I would say it could be a course on skillshare or udemy or something else it could be a YouTube tutorial where you're learning something new something that scales your knowledge base but something you could point back to and you could say I have a better better understanding of how the world works now than I did even one month ago and I attribute that to you know this Source yeah I love that I I think I it's funny I'll take that even 10 steps more Broad and just say you need to be learning new things right like we cannot get stuck so I think that's one of the beautiful things about our Phi mindset right and the whole community that we have here is we are people who like to learn we are never getting stuck on that's the way you do it or that's the way I've always done it or some other nonsense it's you need to learn and the best way to do that I mean just there's so many free resources Jonathan like you said obviously YouTube jumps to mind I suspect that's on this list somewhere but you can learn essentially anything you need in the entire world on YouTube we talked about the library there are free courses the the moocs the what are they the massively open online courses whatever they stand for there's Khan Academy there's you know like you said sure personal finance books are great but you know you kind of run to the end of that pretty quickly but you can then get into psychology like why do humans work like why do we work the way we work right like what makes us tick that I've found is a never-ending well of information and it just it just helps you get better as a person when you can spot your own biases and blind spots so yeah I think very broadly is never stop learning and you know Jonathan that kind of ties into number four here on the list was just learn a new skill right like that's uh something near and dear to your heart and I mean that ties in both in terms of just learning something new in terms of you know just background knowledge but also then learning maybe a marketable skill or just something that's that interests you right like it doesn't have to be something you're going to turn into a job necessarily though it certainly might yeah you know I think uh between both of those combined when you when you start to think about your life as this Venn diagram and all of it should hopefully point to balance right but there's these different aspects of your life that you're trying to lean into to with a little bit more of a priority at various points that early on it's like to get an education that will allow us to get a job that's usually something that is and so you know when we're talking about skills you could pursue skills that will allow you to earn additional income to increase your earning potential you could learn skills that allow you to relate to other humans in a better manner to to understand yourself and what motivates you to be able to extract more results you know out of the time that you're given on this Earth You could learn skills that allow you to develop your health I know that's something that is it's a lifetime to master right and so you need to at varying points really lean into that there's so many different ways that you can take skills but you should never get complacent but there's one little there's kind of like a little line of delineation here we're going to talk about this in a future episode because it's something that I'm still struggling with because I think especially in The Entrepreneur Space we look at complacency as a bad thing which you know most of us say yeah okay don't get complacent but I think sometimes we lose sight of also the other half of that which is content you know and and so sometimes being content can look like complacency and I think it's it's important to kind of check ourselves to understand are we are we happy with where we are what is it that drives us and what is our why we'll talk about that I think there's a whole episode around that that I want to come back to in a future point but I think that as creatures we were born to do more than watch Netflix you know we were born to do more than than just consume so if you are going to consume let's consume with an eye towards how can we take the consumption of knowledge and turn that into creation down the road and it doesn't have to be for income potential it could be for your own fulfillment but just I think you'll get more value out of that long term than binge watching the HBO Max you know archives the Netflix archives Etc Brad did you want to add anything on there yeah no I that that covers it for learning a new skill I'd say I think you know some of these other this is amazing I I kind of want to touch on every single one of these we could do probably uh 30 episodes but right exercise at home and try a new hiking or biking trail every week you know get outside you can exercise and you can spend money for glasses and and In fairness I'm not knocking that you know my wife and I are both members that CrossFit and and we love it but we also exercise at home we also love to get outside we actually just uh took a little vacation a couple weeks ago and Jonathan did this really cool Bicycle Tour kind of like down this mountain it was in Southwest Virginia it was it was amazing it was called the Virginia Creeper Trail it was one of like the single coolest family family vacations we've ever had it was just being out in nature right and it was just it was really really neat like there's just so much to be said for for just mixing it up right doing something different so there's a never-ending you know again going back to YouTube right like there's a never-ending stream of free exercise classes you could take classes from world-class experts and everything from strength training to yoga to meditation to whatever right like easily for free on YouTube so it's not a question of if it's there it's just a question of are you going to open up that browser and search and actually do it right I love it I asked your adventure by the way we put that on our uh on our list as well we want to like oh you sparked the idea all right we're not letting that one go let's go lock that down it sounded absolutely fantastic there are so many on this list dude I don't think we can mention every single one and there's they're actually all of them are really good like these are not throwaway ideas all of these are like oh yeah each one of them Sparks its own level of let's dive a little bit deeper but I think you know you just mentioned uh hiking and biking you know there are other things that you can do in your community and there's some suggestions here and you know I think one great way of of how can I get more involved in my community and how can I look at my community Through maybe a you know a five lens is make sure you're aware of your local choose fi group and what's going on there now kovitz been a very interesting time for all of us but you know we're we're coming through this you know and Community is going to mean more now than ever so do your part to invest in your local community and you'll reap the rewards for decades it's it's truly phenomenal if you want to access that you want to find out more about the the local groups in your area just go to choosefi.com local let's go ahead and move into this next category it's it's really more focused on your finances but I think it's gonna be apple for many people that are maybe new to the financial Independence path and that is dealing with debt you know where I don't have the luxury of really thinking about the other side I'm still buried in debt right now and I just found this what do my one percent actions my one percent improvements what should I be considering so Brad I'll let you start yeah I mean I think for me if you're in debt I think this actually comes back to the very first action you should take when you first find the concept of Phi which is you got to sit down and you have to be honest with yourself right you need to say like where am I today right and it's not beating yourself up about things in the past but it's about taking action to make yourself better right truly that one percent better so it's all right what do I oh who do I owe how much do I owe what is my current like income statement look like right how much am I making and how much am I spending every month if that's negative if that's in the red you've got an emergency on your hands right and you need to fix that and and that kind of goes hand in hand with stop using your credit cards right like we are not the the anti-credit card place here obviously Jonathan we talk one of our our major kind of Life Strategies is using uh travel rewards points that come from credit cards but that's for people who have a handle on it right clearly that's a totally different ball game but for people who are in debt and continue to shuffle themselves deeper you need to stop you need to stop using your credit cards you need to figure out hey what does this look like what do I have to do what can I do this month to cut some expenses maybe earn some more money how can I get at least to a point where I'm not adding to my debt so I don't know that that to me is just like the overriding starting point here but you know obviously then you can move on from there with like real strategies on how to tackle that and that really does get you know once we once we are in that place now we're looking at figuring out you know what is that strategy is it a debt snowball is it a debt Avalanche are these new terms that you don't even know about let's dive down that rabbit hole and find out is there a way that we could optimize even our debt repay off and you know you could get even more complex and say are there more advanced strategies like you know I have a bunch of credit card debt that's very high interest are there any you know credit cards zero balance transfer strategies out there that I could layer on top of this you probably wouldn't start there you're going to start with what is my debt how long will it take me to pay it off how should I approach this but you know this is something uh Brad maybe you could think about that episode that we did with the debt free guys where they really talked about that additional complexity as another layer to this so I'll let you come back to that but even all that that implies that you're working with the credit system and for many people to find themselves in this situation you know they're coming from this hair on fire scenario they have bad credit so you know credit for better or worse is something that seems to be an operating structure for the world that we all live in and those that have good credit tend to have access to better rates and prices throughout you know all of their purchasing habits over time so it would probably be in all of our best interests to understand what is that score how is it comprised how can I improve it and get on a plan to improve your credit score yeah the credit score is a big one it really is but yeah like you said you need to you need to get to that point of stability and for a lot of people the credit score that that is going to increase over months and years and it's just a matter of of doing the right things right it's paying on time and in full every single month never missing a payment I think people there's a lot of just unforced errors you know it's hey I didn't I didn't make that payment on time because I was lazy or I missed it or I didn't have a system set up right I didn't have a system set up to auto pay this because hey maybe at that point I didn't have any money in the bank and I had to worry about oh no am I getting my paycheck on the 14th of the month and this credit card bill was due you know two days later but maybe I got paid you know like all these things like when you're coming from a place of stability into strength financially right then you can make decisions based on hey how can I how can I make this easy easy right at the heart of this a lot of it is based on Simplicity how do I set up a system like personally I'm never going to miss a credit card payment because I have it on autopay that is a one let's not I mean I don't see that on this list we should probably add it that is a massive one percent Improvement that's like locked and loaded once you do it so I I genuinely Brad because until we really discussed this it wasn't on my my radar as well but I could literally check that button it's not something that I think comes by default when you sign up for a card make sure people understand what that means practically why they need to do that today yeah and and thanks I'm sorry to to gloss over that because yeah it's not obvious but when you sign up for a credit card let's say it's with American Express or chase I have you know a number of cards from them and I just go into the payments area and I'm able to set up an auto pay and you basically you log in you put in your you know very securely obviously put in your checking account information and they just pull the money out on what whatever the due date is for that that credit card and you can actually specify like let's say for instance you or someone I'm not advocating this obviously I'm advocating paying info every month in a perfect world but for people who can only pay the minimum or can only pay a certain amount you can set up even the amount that you auto pay I just click pay full statement balance and that happens every month on the exact same date and it is so so easy to set up it takes five minutes and again that's one of those things you know we say front load the sacrifice right like jokingly here the sacrifice is five minutes to set this up but you took that extra five minutes and you never have to think about it again you never have to think about oh do I need to log in to pay this do I need to write a check and mail this off right like it's just done so I think anytime you can set up a system and that's certainly Jonathan that's you know a much larger point in terms of probably all of this one percent better it's like how can you set up systems so that you can't fail right totally agree that's a big one and I think a lot of people you could have that done today and you may never have had that before it's just uh it's do it all right we're going to move into emergency fund savings and I want to actually change the term here slightly as we roll into because there is yes having an emergency fund or having access to funds that you can use for you know things that life throws at you but many people are starting out they don't even have a thousand dollars that doesn't have you know three or four names attached to it of where it needs to go and if you do not have a thousand dollars to your name you don't need an emergency fund you need a crisis fund you need to have a thousand dollars that doesn't have a bill attached to it that you could draw on if you need it for something at a moment's notice it's a huge priority now once you have that thousand dollars now maybe we start talking about having an emergency fund and where that emergency fund needs to be and a couple strategies here's an interesting one if this is your first year really getting started with us most people that are just starting to pay attention to their finances are going to get a tax refund and what an opportunity instead of buying your next vacation to use that to take care of the crisis respond and put something you know into some investments into some savings and then here's how you can get one percent better do whatever you can not to get a tax refund the following year and Brad I'll give this back to you because I know as a former accountant this is something that just never made sense to you and it seems to make sense to everybody else so let you stop here why would we want to not get a tax refund going forward yeah this this is counterintuitive for a lot of people right because you just for most people who can't save money don't save money the only kind of force savings they have is that that big tax refund that they get every year a couple thousand bucks whatever it may be and it almost seems akin to free money right like oh the government is just giving me money back here's my tax refund it's this magical thing but that's your money that's your money that you have withheld from your paycheck every single paycheck or pay period for the entire year and you've been using that basically that's your tax withholding that offsets against whatever your tax liability is that's the actual tax you owe it's not that withholding because just as a thought experiment you could theoretically withhold 100 of your money right like that doesn't mean that's what you actually owe the government that's just the amount that you decided to send them to hold on to to offset against that money so long story short you really don't want a big tax refund that's not ideal at all because what that means is the government has been holding that money for you for potentially over a year in some cases right from your let's say your January paycheck from the prior Year all the way through April 15th and you're not earning any interest on that you're not doing anything productive with that you're not investing in the stock market you're not investing it wherever right like the opportunity cost of that is potentially big now again this is all predicated on once you're following the paths of fine you have a savings rate you're not gonna just magically blow that extra money on on garbage right it's going to go into savings each paycheck so for someone who's financially responsible you don't want a big tax refund it doesn't make any sense so the ideal Jonathan We've joked about this before right the ideal tax return is plus or minus 100 bucks so either you know can you get in that range of I owe between 100 to getting a refund of a hundred it's really really really hard to do but uh if we ever had some sort of like gamification Pathway to financial Independence like an app or something like that it would be a place where you could self-report if you got inside that number and there would be some gamification points on the other side because that's serious Pro level tip you know as you start to progress through this journey yeah and it is hard to to change your mindset on that there's no question about it but yeah a tax refund is not your friend it's just your money that you should have had all along so don't think about it as free money hey this is Andrew from the choose fi team hope you're enjoying the show we're gonna get right back to it after these quick messages [Music] all right we're gonna move down categories here and we're going to talk about home expenses and uh Brad I know this is one that I think you've actually added a little bit to your skill stack with your uh watching YouTube videos to do some home repairs but I think all of us you know there's some stuff that you're gonna need a handyman to do it's gonna be outside your proficiency likely or you could learn it but it's going to cost you a lot to learn it or to buy the tool to do it Etc but there's other stuff that you can do a lot and it's probably a lot more than you can think and it's probably worth just doing a couple searches for everything that you encounter on YouTube to just get a sense for what's actually involved and you might actually go to this you know mythical store that's out there called like Lowe's or Home Depots and just to see what stuff they actually have there and whether or not you could bring one item back and get it actually fixed with the benefit of a YouTube tutorial Brad I know we did one other episode where we talked about even if even if that one handyman project feels a little bit too far out there we talked about the light bulb situation and how that is no one has an excuse for not being able to change a light bulb it's more than a meme yeah it is much more than a meme and yeah I mean that's something you can replace your old incandescent bulbs if you have any with uh you know newer technology LED and the like I mean that that theoretically should save you long term I think there's you know other things you can do that you know maybe something like even as simple as adjusting your thermostat right by a couple degrees like again none of what we talk about at choose a buy none of this is about deprivation so you know listen if you value a home at a certain temperature go for it feel free but right for the rest of us like I mean we've actually come to the point where now because in the summer we keep our house probably like 79 or 80 degrees like when we have our air conditioner pumping it actually feels uncomfortable to walk in from like a 95 degree Richmond day to like a 70 degree house like it feels unusual like we trained ourselves to the point where like it actually is much more comfortable this way so but that's said at night we value sleeping in a cold environment so you know we lower it down at night and and this works both ways right because we save money on heat in the winter and maybe spend a little bit extra on air conditioning in the summer but you know again it's what you value can you make these little little changes right like lowering the temperature on your hot water heater I mean there are people that when you put your hot water on it's scalding like is that really necessary you know no I don't think so I think it's actually beneficial to lower the temperature so you know is this going to make you wealthy overnight no it's not but again it's a Jonathan it's about stacking these things right like that's the whole point about the one percent better you know it is kind of funny as you're talking about deprivation or rather pushing the limits of what you can do with your AC it reminded me of uh Tanya Hester from our next life and this was a fun thing that her and her husband did was just like they want to be wearing gloves before they go change the thermostat and it's funny and funny as that was I actually remind me we have a kind of a meme I guess you would say I've pulled it up here for those of you that are watching the YouTube channel but this is just a quick easy pick could put on your thermostat I'll run you through the flowchart analysis Brad can you see it on my screen it might be I'll read it I got it all right so here it is you got your old Honeywell thermostat and you got to post it on there and here's the conditions that you have set for you know those kids coming behind you that are thinking about changing it before turning the heat on do you question number one these are yes no questions do you have socks on yes or no do you have a long sleeve shirt on yes or no do you have underwear or pants on yes or no can you see your breath no or yes no if any of these are selected you know yes yes yes no for the last one it's a trick one no heat is needed and then the combination on the other side is no no or yes so yes being you could see your breath then it's uh it's get dressed so you can be a little bit more hardcore and you can go towards an option like that and see I think I don't think my wife would let me put this up but it is a valiant effort and I appreciate the creativity and the logic that went into it for the engineers out there yeah that is funny the the other one that kind of jumps out to me the last one from this category is declutter and donate room by room and this kind of this goes back to what I said you know 20 minutes ago about the The Oasis like I mean we even even my family like we find ourselves getting you know the house gets cluttered It's just sometimes you know it just it happens bit by bit and yeah I mean you can really declutter you can donate you can possibly sell things uh you know we we generally prefer to to donate but with a lot of the different marketplaces like there's a way to to make some money on selling some of these unused things and and you have to again it comes back to being honest with yourself right like that's that's what I said is that's the first step of Phi with your finances but like it comes down to that with everything you know Chris Hutchins was talking about this last episode about like hey have you worn those clothes in the last six six months yeah I would even extend it to 12 let's say right so you know Season by season but like if you haven't worn something in in a year or two you're probably never gonna wear it it might be tons of donate so I think that's kind of a cool concept all right we move on to categories here we could talk about Transportation expenses and we can certainly talk about this but Brad we actually did a great episode I think it's aged actually really well it was Episode 22 of our podcast where we talked about the high cost of car ownership and I think if you could just pull out at a high level why this matters to our actual five number and yes it's a one percent decision but it makes a meaningful difference on you know how much money we're going to have when we reach Financial Independence yeah we like you said episode 22 definitely check that out we talked two different ways so you talked about the kind of year by year differences and I actually looked it's interesting how we kind of think differently but it's the same concept of I looked at the long-term ramifications of basically like managing the payment on your leased car or constantly having a new car whatever every five years or thereabouts versus buying I even said a new car right but you know in all likelihood the better one percent better is uh buying a used car and holding that car for 15 years right you have three of those Cycles over as ridiculous as it sounds a 45-year period I mean the savings the savings of that compounded when you know you're investing that difference and we actually said in that episode it was almost three quarters of a million dollars over 45 years 742 thousand dollars is how we estimated it and that's one decision on your car so that is probably the best example of why these one percent these aggregation or marginal gains why it all adds up imagine when you start doing multiple of these you know somewhat substantial decisions right like you save three or four hundred dollars a month on food and I'm sure Jonathan that's on the list here but right like 300 400 a month on whatever right like your housing situation or whatever it may be like you start stacking three four five of those things you're literally talking multiple millions of dollars over your lifetime just for decisions that you are not gonna feel at all that's the beautiful part about this yeah I mean if we make smarter decisions around our investing we make smarter decisions around our tax optimization we make smarter decisions around our transportation and we optimize you know our I want to I guess I'll go with our food budget right now you know if we just kind of look at these at these big pillars and we just try to be a little bit better than average we don't need to be the world's greatest at any one of them we certainly don't need to push the lines of deprivation on any of them but if we can just do better than average and not Hemorrhage money in these categories you're going to have millions more than your counterpart that's just kind of drifting through their financial life that's that is not hyperbole that's just compound interest working for you instead of against you yeah and Jonathan one other you know talk about drifting through financial life I I know this is one thing that that I'm guilty of on this list here number 33 is shop your car insurance rates every year and I would extend this to shopping all of your insurance rates every year I think this is one of those things that we just need to have as part of our yearly to do tasks right like I should have this in my todoist list I don't know it's kind of criminal that I don't but you would be shocked at how much money you can save and I think it's funny I keep extending these things but it's amazing how this spins out because all of these these Concepts they're just so similar like we think that companies treat us well because we've been with them a long time and it almost invariably works the opposite way right like you get special teaser rates for your whatever your cable right or your cell phone or whatever maybe for being a new customer so the companies aren't incentivizing you for staying they're incentivizing you to come to them so and really what that means then is to leave your old company right so I think that's just it's unfortunate that that's how it works but frankly that is how it works that's how life is so we need to be aware of that right so what you should be doing is you should be getting quotes that might mean if you switch as annoying as this is once a year between if you have it in your time you know Verizon and Comcast that's what we have right for our cable it's annoying to switch every year but I guarantee you you're going to save 20 to 50 right and the same Works more broadly with insurance I find that you will be shocked at how much you can save whether that's your car insurance your homeowners insurance your term life insurance and these policies you know at the end of the day they're all substantially similar I'm sure you know they're insurance agents listening who are going to get mad at me at that but they're they're substantially similar I won't say they're identical but you know in most cases you can do pretty well just doing this on price don't tell Verizon but I would never leave Verizon to go to Comcast ever ever ever so if you're like but I wouldn't really leave you still need to negotiate and if you're not really willing to negotiate that you just that it makes you cringe to even think about it there are services that will do this for you now they're going to take a little piece of the savings that's how they make their money but they will do it for you and they will do it just when they know it's coming up I'm thinking of companies like trim I think if you go to chooseify.com trim we have a whole article talking about them as a service and they they actually will negotiate these bills on your behalf and then for the homeowners insurance Brad is not using this one I am and I was shocked at how quick they gave me the rate and how inexpensive this rate was I mean we're living in the future here they can do a lot of this stuff just using algorithms go to choosefi.com Lemonade if you want more information like I was in a pinch where the one insurance company was gonna drop me because I was working from home we're all working from home like seriously they wanted to drop me because I was working from home and so I needed Insurance fast and I went with lemonade and I was shocked at how good the deal was how great the rate was and their whole claim to fame is that they pay out faster than anyone else with like literally no friction so uh between the amazing rate and the payout it's it's probably worth checking out shoesify.com lemonade those are just a couple examples for those of you that that was something that appealed to you and you know you're overdue on that as we scroll through these the next category that we were going to talk about was Healthcare and and I think anybody said oh what do you got oh yeah we figured figured it out Healthcare and all of you are on system and Brad and I we are just on this fast lane to happiness of Healthcare inside the United States and we've been holding out on you the entire time we're joking because we're really crying inside trying desperately it's it's to the point dude you start wondering about these whole experiments where just like I think Mr Money Mustache did it where he just I'm just gonna go a couple years without health insurance and just see how it goes and I mean it's like they are like trying to push the line of like how expensive can we make it before people actually start considering that as a valid strategy that's the reality of where we are here in the United States uh but having said that inside the confines of this is what we got to work with and uh we're not we're not out of account and we're not and we're not advocating that then Brad there are a few a few ways that you can you can optimize inside the margins and I will share just two and then I know you let's because you've experienced a couple more recently I'll let you stack on those more nuanced ones after this the one is you know we can go with a high deductible plan and we can take advantage of the HSA which gives us additional pre-tax options for those of us that have that available to us uh and then on the uh the pharmacy side I'll just go and throw this one out there when you have medications that you need to get there's a free tool we're not affiliated with them but there's a free tool you can use called GoodRx that will allow you to look for discount codes or coupon codes we've actually talked about this in depth on another episode so I won't go into all the Nuance of this but for those of you that have high deductible plans that means you're paying a disproportionate amount out of pocket and you know you're not going to hit your deductible each year then the discounts that these that GoodRx will provide you will be astonishingly low and it can make a very compelling case to just you know take the discount card as opposed to running it through your insurance which is insane but that again is just the crazy world that we are inside the United States so Brad I know you've actually layered on maybe a comparable approach to the the medicine side and it would be a good time to Overlay that here yeah and that's it's funny that's actually the strategy that I've taken so for me our health insurance is literally like the definition of insurance which is just catastrophe more or less at this point so if I get hit by a bus or have a heart attack or something like then it will come in handy but I've come to the conclusion now that we have such a high deductible that there's almost invariably a better way to get some price certainty and to ultimately then save some money and just do it outside of the the insurance policy which is sad that you know we're paying a huge amount of premiums every month and it's essentially for nothing but it's really not for nothing right it's for that catastrophe and as long as I've I've kind of come to grips mentally with that it's uh it at least helps me helps me sleep at night and I've come to various levels of grips yeah yeah but what I have found so just real quick my uh you know because we can belabor this for hours so I've mentioned this probably five times on the last last month or two I have not used this service but I will the next time that I have any type of health issue that's not a catastrophe again it's something that I can plan in advance there's a website called mdsave.com that again allows you to basically purchase with price certainty certain types of tests and procedures from reputable providers in your area you know in a perfect world that mdsave has uh doctors and Facilities that they've uh they've worked with in your area I think Jonathan for us unfortunately the closest is about an hour away but still I would have saved over a thousand dollars on a CT scan that I had a couple months ago and I didn't know about MDC so yeah that unfortunately is one thousand dollars that is just burned in a fireplace as far as I'm concerned that I would still have in my bank account had I known about that so that is a cool one I've I've been doing some uh kind of a la carte blood testing and there's a website called ultralabtests.com Ulta lab tests plural.com and that's really wonderful they uh they actually do it through like the major like Quest Diagnostics so you just show up you have an appointment and it's really really cheap and again it comes down to price certainty because sometimes you get blood tests done and it shows up and you owe 400 and I could have gotten it for 37.95 through Ulta so I'm actually going for another vitamin D test tomorrow actually Jonathan so this is uh something that I personally have used and it's really great well you know the next option is we're going to look at groceries and dining out but I think it really Stacks really nicely because what we're talking about here is lifestyle you know factors and it is hard to overstate how much health benefits there are to you having more time to focus on exercise and the food choices that you're making uh you know I was actually just talking to a buddy of mine he's a rheumatologist and he was kind of belaboring or bemoaning the fact that he just doesn't have as much time to spend with his patients talking about lifestyle and diet factors and what was the roost cause that they're actually seeing him it's just not really built into the model it's more how is the treatment progressing if you have the time to spend experimenting on your health experimenting on the foods that you know promote a healthier lifestyle experimenting on like how much exercise does your your body need to me I mean I would say probably 80 90 percent of you know the treatment modalities that we see out there would go so much farther if they're stacked on a healthy diet and lifestyle I mean maybe you could say as much as 100 but you know for the sake of this conversation we'll just say this is the 80 20. there are pre-existing conditions there are genetic conditions there are things that are unavoidable but it is hard to overstate the power that slowly cleaning up your diet and lifestyle will have on your long-term Health it is the core foundation and so you know when we talk about groceries and dining out when we talk about you know making meals at home instead of eating everything out of a box a frozen box it's going to have a massive impact when we talk about you knowing what's actually going inside your food instead of you know the fast food restaurant that was more easily accessible every single day it is hard to overstate the power that'll happen there so you know we need to then look okay well we understand fundamentally like when we know what we're actually the ingredients that are actually going into our meals that's that's going to be a definitely a one percent Improvement how can we you know come up with some sort of like framework or parameters for what is a good amount to spend on our meals like what's an appropriate amount to budget how do I know if I'm crushing it versus just doing better than average and I think Brad this is where you and Laura have talked about really comes in handy as just a framework it's not prescriptive but I think it is useful for people just to have something in mind yeah agreed and and this is what we've talked about on the podcast many many times is is my wife and I kind of anchor ourselves to two dollars per person per meal for dinners and that might sound like a shockingly low number but over the course of really the last decade we've curated Laura has curated a series of of recipes that are fantastic absolutely delicious certainly I would say well well above average on the health side and are at or near that two dollars per person per meal so I think this is one of those like just major as you said Jonathan major like force multipliers in life is you can get healthier you can feel better and you can save a boatload of money right we talked about the cars right saving three or four hundred dollars a month can be three quarters of a million over a 45 year period I mean you could most people can really cut out about 500 per month on their food budget just with applying a little intentionality so we actually have a PDF download of 30 of these meals that Laura and I eat pretty much you know this is our yearly meals more or less so uh choose a vita.com meals and yeah you can just get this nice PDF download and yeah let me know if you if you eat any of these so I get I get emails Jonathan all the time at feedback shoesify.com with people who are like oh I had your chicken copper couch it was the best thing I've ever made and yeah it's just it's really cool I would highly highly recommend that so that is a major Force multiplier and and yeah just kind of last word on this health area is uh you know groceries and health you know Jonathan you this is something like you're not speaking from a a place on high like that's something you know you have talked here many times about how you you know struggle with your weight and you know it seems like you're at a point now where like you are at that steady state which is just really really cool so again it's not about just making drastic changes necessarily it's about putting systems in place that set you up for long-term success and I think nothing can describe Phi better than that more broadly right setting up systems that set you up for long-term success I would give yeah being on the path to fi all the credit for finally having the time to really find out about myself understand myself a little bit better and you know what are the routines that we're sending me to a dark place and what are the systems that allow me to really be where I want to be at a particular point in time all right guys I think we have covered you know as really as many as we could fit into this episode I want to give you just a couple more categories to think of to spark you know some some ideas here and I would encourage you just go to the show notes for this episode and uh or Brad did we have a short link I'm trying to remember we have it was it chooseify.com one percent to see the full article choose a vi.com one percent that's uh the number one and then percent p-e-r-c-e-n T it'll take you to the full episode as you guys start to kind of map this out and think about what other you know kind of categories could we consider they're certainly your clothing your there's your shopping and your services that you're using on a regular basis we talked a little bit about how to negotiate things like internet cell phone and entertainment a lot of things that you can do there there's some stuff in the child care category I know for those of you that are trying to look for ways to optimize there's some really good ideas there uh travel and sightseeing we talk about this all the time in fact we just talked about it this past episode but I will say for those of you that want to learn how can I basically create for myself an extra I don't know two to four thousand dollars a year and just totally extra income that you can use tax-free to travel anywhere around the world it's probably worth your time to find out about this you could go check out chooseify.com travel for our free course on how to do it and Brad we recently put together an episode really talking about some of the updated strategies right now do you have that episode of number yeah that was episode 311 so yeah basically you know for all of us we're getting back into travel and you know it really if you haven't already it's really time to start accumulating travel rewards points and Jonathan you and I have talked uh so many times how uh Chase Ultimate Rewards points are absolute favorite so highly highly highly recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and you can read our full review if you go to chooseify.com CSP that's CSP for Chase Sapphire preferred so yeah that's uh that's a really great one yeah I mean travel there's tons of ways to save money so there's a great list here you know Jonathan some of these things we talked already like you actually mentioned a minute ago negotiate right like that's one of those things that I think people need to really consider and that one of the freezes that jump out to us is everything is negotiable right it never hurts to ask like again I actually you know I was talking about Healthcare before I ended up having uh everything's fine by the way I'm perfectly healthy but I I had a a routine procedure but you know unfortunately it was an expensive routine procedure and I actually just asked hey is there a painful discount and they said because it was just it was slightly over a thousand dollars so it was because it was over a thousand dollars I got a 30 discount Jonathan so I was literally going to pay the full amount with my credit card but I just asked that simple question and they gave me 30 off so I got you know right you were going in to pay it and then they're like if I pay it can you give me a discount so you know there's there's lots of things that we just need to we just need to rethink right like we've talked about cell phones cell phones are another just super simple one that you can save a boatload of money on a lot of people are still even in 2021 are paying a hundred dollars a month for the unlimited package of everything like I mean I pay 15 dollars a month on my cell phone you know there's mint mobile there's your public wireless there's other comparable different companies I mean there's no excuse to be paying 80 to 100 a month anymore on your cell phone so I mean that's it's just thinking a little bit differently you know it's just looking for what are the new options not oh this is what I've done for the last 10 years you just need to scrutinize and it doesn't mean it's hard it doesn't mean you have to waste a lot of time but like these are really high value changes couldn't agree more you know saving money puts more money in your pocket the other thing that puts more money in your pocket is earning more money and uh the last kind of category we have so many kind of suggestions to spark that rabbit hole here on this article uh it's worth looking into I mean there's never been really an easier time to just start a side hustle or start an income producing opportunity with very little risk so whether we're talking about salary negotiation whether we're looking at looking at pivoting into a new industry using a new skill that we've learned or whether we're looking at our investment it's how do I you know how do I optimize my investments reduce fees Etc these are all worth your times and they all count so Brad does this bi-weekly every single week where he's asking for the action that you've taken wouldn't it be cool if you use the next 52 weeks to talk about how you got one percent better and maybe use this article as an opportunity to spark the idea and then take action on that idea so Brad I just mentioned your newsletter we'll just we'll just round up this episode with that how can they find out more about that and what should they expect if they do yeah so every Tuesday I put out the bi-weekly and it's just it's it's really like the most fun thing I do all week it's just like this hey what's been going on what have I come across it's interesting that I think will be useful for the community and it's just a variety of things from inspirational quotes to money saving tips to hey the tax deadline got extended to May 17th this year right and also really focusing on what is the community be doing to take action I ask every single week to hit reply and tell me what was the action you took this week to make your life better and I mean Jonathan you actually went into our email system recently and like you were blown away by the responses again right it's just it's very interesting place it's a very positive awesome Place yeah if you're ever ever feeling bad about yourself you just log into that email and just see wow people are listening to the show and as a community we are taking action right we're trying to make our lives better and it sounds trite but it genuinely starts from these small changes right you don't need to move tomorrow to a low-costed living area like you can just make a phone call and ask for a better price on your cable right like that one thing and they're gonna start snowballing you're gonna add these up you're gonna have dozens hundreds of changes and your life is going to be dramatically changed for the better so Jonathan I think uh this one percent better is really one one of the most important just overall Frameworks that we really have ever touched on here yeah Brad couldn't agree more and it's nice to kind of see them all come together and really a lot of care has been put into aggregating these over literally hundreds of episodes in one place for you to really spark that springboard so for individuals listen to this that want to participate in that newsletter go to chooseify.com subscribe last thing I want to say here Brad just want to tack it on the end I feel like you mentioned on this last episode that there is going to be a campfire coming up the Mid-Atlantic campfire is coming up and you are planning on going and so I wanted to confirm that that is a true statement and if it is true for individuals that wanted to find out more where can they go for the details yeah so it is a mostly mostly true statement I am planning on going I haven't exactly locked down the days that I'm going to be there but yeah I'm really excited that uh Steven is holding this event yeah it's campfires are back which is super cool so it looks like this one in Virginia is over Memorial Day weekend so May 28th through the 31st and you can find out all the details you can just Google campfi or just go directly to campfi.org so yeah this is pretty cool I can't uh can't wait to be back in person with the fight Community it's been goodness it's
