sticks that were that were nice I actually   saw those in a store That was a thing in the 
70s maybe when you guys were in college But   easy easy We got a great show today We're going 
to talk about so many things Doug you mentioned   a bunch of them Emergency funds inheritances 
Uh we're going to talk about nefariousness   in the brokerage community student loans 
financial planning for single people just   so so so many great questions you guys brought 
to us If you've got a question you know what   The mailbag now we're going to move a lot toward 
emptying it today Benjamins.com/voicemail We're   going to impact zero Yeah we're not there yet 
but we are closing in So ask your question and   hopefully later on this summer or early in the 
fall we'll be able to answer your question But   first before we hear from all the goodness 
you stackers have brought our way we've got   a couple of sponsors who make sure that this is 
free and you don't have to pay for any of this   goodness We're going to hear from them and then 
we're into the mailbag with your your questions All right guys Let's not dillydally Let's begin 
this shindig with a great question from Torren   Hey Torren Hey Joan OG Question about saving for a 
house So in 3 years I may have to buy a new house   I would like to keep the one that I currently 
own and rent that out So selling is not an ideal   option While I save for that house since it's 
possible it's in the more short term Does it make   sense to put that money in a more conservative 
investment like a high yield savings account Or   is it better to do a more aggressive approach with 
investing in the stock market since I may not need   that money in three years after all Or is there 
a hybrid approach where I should put some portion   of the money in a more conservative investment 
and a portion of that money in a more aggressive   investment Appreciate your help Torren Thank 
you Thank you Thank you so much for the question   OG maybe a house in three years but it sounds like 
that timeline might be flexible Does he invest   the money or just go high yield savings Well he 
got me with the maybe And that's really the most   important piece I think the way that I would look 
at this is I would say what happens if you need it   in three years and the market's down 20% Are you 
in a position in three years to go I'll just rent   for a year and wait it out or does that radically 
change your new house approach down the line Does   that mean that you can't get one Does that mean 
you can't take the new job Does that mean that   you have to sell the house that you don't want to 
sell What are the dominoes that fall if the market   doesn't behave in the manner in which you hope 
it behaves And if you can't absorb it all then   you have to go cash or something like cash If it's 
like well it could be three but if I get there and   it's not I'm not ready I'm happy with renting for 
a year and let the market do its thing Or it might   be three it might be five it could be never but 
you never know I'm much more open to investing it   because of the unknown But just you you got to be 
okay with what happens if you saved 100 grand and   all of a sudden you got 80 What do you do Yeah I 
like the way you turn that upside down what most   people think because most people start off with 
what's optimal and optimal as we talked about   on Monday It's so much in the eye of the beholder 
and it's got there's so many factors I definitely   love your way of thinking which is which one would 
disappoint you the most because we want to avoid   that one and clearly if you get to three years and 
it's down 20% you go yeah I can't do that because   you know I may seriously have to move I can't 
wait Well then you just answered your question   Yeah What would disappoint you the most I think 
is speaking of optimal a much more optimal way   to answer questions than which one is the best 
case scenario Look at avoiding the worst case   scenario What are the behavioral economists say 
that losing feels twice as bad as winning feels   good Yeah Statistically or however you want to 
say that you know emotionally So yeah I don't even   think about it like disappoint because I'd still 
be disappointed if I was down 20% and I didn't   need the money But what are the changes that 
have to happen because of it If you can absorb   it and you go "Well in a perfect world I'm buying 
a $500,000 house I'm going to put $100,000 down."   But if I get there and I only can put 80 down 
whatever I don't care Like yeah it's a little bit   bigger mortgage payment I'm fine with it I might 
have to pay PMI I don't care I'm fine You know if   you're good with all that then full send man But 
if it's like no no I I absolutely need to have   100 grand And if I have 99.5 I am toast There's no 
way I can afford it There's no way I can get this   done I can't take the job I can't move across the 
country You know like whatever I have to sell the   house I don't want to sell Catastrophe Then then 
yeah you have to pick cash There's also degrees   then of investing OG because if he's not looking 
at three years then the next obvious question is   is okay what's the maximum length you would go 
Turns out it's five or it's six years I think   that's different than if he looks at 10 isn't it 
I mean is this a case when I go from high yield   savings to bonds because then I'm notching up the 
potential return but I'm also keeping that risk in   check No not in my opinion Because the yield curve 
does not benefit you for lending money longer than   shorter a lot The difference between lending money 
to the bank so if you buy a six-month CD or a   two-year CD you get an increase in your rate right 
because you're locking your money up for two years   If you do a two-year CD versus a 5year CD it's not 
the same rate of change as 6 months to two years   was If you go 5 to 10 it's darn near flat So you 
lock your money up for 10 years but you don't get   much more return Yeah but I'm talking like a bond 
fund where his expectation might be 6 and a half   versus four That's my point A six-year bond pays 
the same as a two-year CD So why would you add the   the risk the potential the fixed income product 
when you could have a guaranteed product of a CD   or or high yield savings with virtually the same 
outcome The other thing that people do with this   stuff sometimes is they look at that yield number 
or return number or something like that and don't   really factor in return on what it's like it's 
like well no no my my savings account gets 4.1   and yours only gets 3.9 Mine is so much more 
superior to yours And it's like well we both   have 10 grand so it's like 20 bucks you know I 
mean how much are we truly talking about real   What are we talking about here You know it's like 
I've got $50,000 in this account and I can get 4%   or I can get 5% I mean it's not zero but it's not 
like lifealtering family tree dynamic money Yeah   And I think that you know and they call this in 
the business the risk premium right I think torren   that's the first thing I do is what OG's talking 
about right now is I take a look at how much money   in real dollars will investing this actually bring 
me and is that is that a gamecher because if it's   not then I don't want to be disappointed back to 
the original part that we talked about if it if   you know investing in the S&P 500 or S&P maybe 
large cap value or something like that would be   um potentially appropriate for this then and 
adds 500 bucks 400 bucks versus the downside   of I could lose 500 bucks Yeah Is a juice worth 
the squeeze Yeah The benefit of compounding at   market rates happens in 20 years not in two You 
just don't I mean you just you just really don't   see it early on Yeah And I wanted to talk to 
about one other thing that you said which I   find this interesting that he doesn't want to 
sell the house He wants to use it as a rental   And I think OG for a lot of people that are just 
experimenting with being a landlord I think this   is a great way to begin that journey just dip 
your toe in a little bit And I don't know if   Torren's doing it because he wants to or because 
he needs to but I think you can learn a lot of   lessons about whether real estate is for you or 
not in this situation by going with one property   Yeah I have a dilemma hearing the words like I 
can't or I never or whatever because it's like   well I mean you could and just choosing not to 
You know you got to keep the power to yourself   You got to be the one in charge of it When you 
say I can't you're putting the you're putting   the power on somebody else And maybe maybe he 
really can't Maybe it's not his house Yeah Maybe   there's some extenduating circumstances he can't 
tell us about But yeah Yeah So that would be the   case But if really I choose to not sell my house 
Now you're deciding to do it And having like we   talked about the other day there's a thousand ways 
to make money There's also a thousand ways to lose   it And I have experimented with being a landlord 
and I absolutely hated it So So best wishes to you   and yours And I hope you are successful cuz I mean 
we were successful financially but I hated every   flipping second of it I know you were successful 
Joe with yours too Like you made money on yours   You just I you just hated it But no thank you Yeah 
You just hated it I hated every minute of it every   minute Wanted nothing to do with it Uh we're going 
to have an episode uh coming up by the way to in   August Paula's going to be our friend Paula Pan 
afford anything is going to be launching her new   course She does every year of my first rental 
property So that might be a episode that you're   going to want to listen to in the future as Paula 
does a deeper dive with us on when you own that   first rental property how to go about making that 
happen and avoid some of the mistakes that Paula   sees quite often Yeah Maybe if we would have got 
her course we wouldn't have sucked so bad at it   That's right If we I totally man I learned 
so many things then and then afterwards once   we really started talking more and more about 
real estate I'm like "Oh yeah I messed that up   That's what you're supposed to do I messed that 
up Oh yeah Capex Didn't know what that was Let's   Let's say hi to Lori in Wisconsin Or how do you 
pronounce that Doug How do you pronounce Wisconsin   Wisconsin There we go Lori we're doing it like 
the home team What's on your mind Lori Hey Joe   OG and Doug This is Lori from Wisconsin Last year 
you answered a question for me that I emailed in   about my daughter Roll Tide You shamed me just 
enough about the email that today I'm trying a   voicemail So here goes Could you go over some 
basics about inherited IAS I have a friend who   just got a small IRA inheritance from her mom that 
was split between her and her siblings I told her   about having to empty the account within 10 years 
But I'm also curious about how RMDs work when the   inheritance is split between beneficiaries How 
does each person know what and how much and when   they have to take money out of the account I know 
inheritances are a big topic but I thought maybe   you could give us a brief overview especially 
about the inherited IRA Thanks much and have a   great day Awesome Lori Thank you so much for the 
question and for stepping up with the voicemail   because guess what's going to happen now Tina 
from our team is going to send you a code and   for being part of the show We pay you in swag I 
thought you meant what's going to happen now is   we're going to talk about her incredible Wisconsin 
accent Delightful It was so good I'm not kidding I   loved it I loved it The other thing that I heard 
was I'm not even making fun of it A little bit of   a roll tide in there I know Yeah she squeaked that 
in there too Former Alabama that threw us It's   fantastic I mean I love Alabama It was a great way 
to start 2024 and a great way to end 2024 Michigan   beating Alabama on January 1st and on December 
31st I mean it couldn't have been a better way   to kind of book end the whole year So and Lor's on 
her way to Texirana to Thank Thank you And uh as   they say roll tide Let's keep that roll going 
We're good with this We like this little out   thing Um inherited IAS they're kind of fun So 
a couple of things you know and this is really   the nitty-gritty stuff of making sure that you do 
this stuff right because at the end of the day the   IRS doesn't really care that you didn't know If 
you say "Well I didn't know that I was supposed   to." Well tough patooties Here's your penalty 
Not our fault that you didn't figure this out   And so a couple things to remember The first 
thing that you have to think about is was the   person who you inherited the IRA from were they 
already receiving RMDs So were they over the age   of 73 That sends you down one path If they 
were not that puts you on a different path   If they are already receiving RMDs then you have 
to follow a different schedule And again this is   something you can do on your own You can use some 
AI tools if you want to double check your math   If you want to hire a CPA or a financial planner 
this is a really good use for that But a lot   of this is DIYable if you get yourself a head 
start You have to like you said take the money   out within the 10 years and you have to take out 
a certain amount every year So there's a schedule   that the IRS produces based on your age and then 
you run the balances It's a December 31 balance   times this number Well it's actually divided by 
this number and then that tells you how much you   have to take out companies like Fidelity Schwab 
whatever they won't tell you what these numbers   are You have to do this yourself But the good 
news is it isn't hard and it accelerates it a   little bit because what they're trying to do 
is look at a percentage of the assets that   you're taking out every year So it may feel like 
it's accelerating a little bit over that 10-year   period Well and for a person that's inheriting 
the IRA let's make some general assumptions here   Let's assume that mom was 70 got hit by the bus 
and the kid that got the money is 45 It's all   based on life expectancy So the life expectancy 
of a 45-year-old is a pretty long time So it's a   really small amount that comes out you know in 
year one and in year two And then the balance   has to come out in year 10 or it has to be all 
done by year 10 So there's a minimum amount the   required minimum distribution RMD There's no 
rule that says that you have to only do that   You can do any amount which goes to why planning 
on this I think is so important OG especially if   it's a big number Well and yes So if you 
get to a situation where it's like mom had   $3 million and I'm 45 and it's in an IRA and I got 
to take out this little teeny tiny bit Oh okay You   know it's like a little bonus like 50 grand Like 
woohoo I made 50 grand Not recognizing that that   3 million turned into 3.3 because it grew by 10% 
Bam And in 10 years from now the three is going   to turn to six if you invest it correctly and 
uh in 10 years from now you're taking 6 million   out that year So much money lost to the IRS and 
now it's 50% to taxes So yeah it does take some   planning If it's a big number if it's a small 
number back to our conversation with the first   question about juice worth the squeeze Let's 
say that the balance of the IRA is 30 grand Do   we really need to be dragging this out over the 
next 10 years 10 years of tax filings 10 years   of paperwork 10 years of separate accounts 10 
years of making sure that you do it the right   way otherwise there's a big penalty or can we just 
pay the piper and move on with life you know And   I think there's a balancing act there You got to 
decide what that threshold is Is it 30 grand Is it   300 I don't know But somewhere in there you got to 
think like is it worth taking $200 a year out of   this thing and all the stuff that goes into it You 
know what I mean Because that's what it would be   Sure your time is not worth that I mean to give 
you an idea just for people that haven't ever   looked at this the RMD for a 73 year old is 3% of 
the account value the first year And so back that   down to a 40-year-old it's going to be 1% You know 
it's a really small number It accelerates like you   said it gets it's a higher percentage every year 
because your life expectancy is decreasing But but   yeah if it's a small number it might make sense 
just to kind of pay the pipe and be done with it   if there's multiple people Our other question was 
how do you deal with those multiple people Well   and before we get there OG just one more thing 
there Lori When you're doing your planning one   thing you're going to want to look at uh while 
you're doing that planning is what tax bracket am   I in and how far away am I from that threshold So 
part of that planning is going to be I'm going to   take out X amount up to the next tax bracket this 
year so I'm not paying any more tax And listen if   I'm a long way from the tax bracket below me and 
I don't expect over the next 10 years that I'm   going to get there I'm just going to fill up the 
tax bracket every year as much as I can so that   I minimize that tax in year 10 if it's a big 
number And to OG's point if it's small I would   still check the tax bracket to see if you want to 
split it maybe between two years Sure If you're   going to pay a little bit more tax but if not then 
go ahead and take it all out in one year and get   it done with Yeah I mean there's some power of 
tax deferral and people would say that and that   sort of thing but you got to weigh all that out 
with with your time and the cost of the CPA and   you know paperwork and all that sort of jazz So 
when there's multiple people as beneficiaries   each person has their own account Joe's got an 
inherited IRA Josh got an inherited IRA Doug's   got an inherited IRA all from mom We all are 
different ages Some of us are profoundly younger   than others so we're going to have a much smaller 
RMD God they didn't Neither of them looked up from   that I thought for sure was going to zing theming 
with the old guy joke and they didn't get it but   um weren't following along That's fine We're 
just too old It just went right over our head   They just went right over your head I couldn't 
hear you You're talking to me Got to turn up my   hearing aids But anyways each person has their 
own schedule that they got to follow and their   own tax responsibility to do it When you split 
it up when you know if you the money's affidelity   and you say "Hey by the way mom died and here's 
all the beneficiary information." And they split   it up Each beneficiary has their own account Each 
beneficiary is their own person you know assuming   that they're an adult anyway And you know off 
they go They got to do their own thing So the   other people are not impacted by other people's 
decisions so to speak Yeah I think she said   something like "My friend inherited the small IRA 
small inherited IRA." Small is relative It all is   like you said based on tax brackets and that sort 
of thing But when I see this I see the juice worth   the squeeze thing and I go "Do we really want 
to be taking 400 bucks a year out for the next   10 years when we can just take 50 grand out right 
now and put it in our brokerage account and let it   grow do its thing you know?" Anyway sorry about 
your friend's parents passing Yeah that sucks Or   a family member I guess you can say was parro 
But just a couple things I've seen from people   For some people this may be obvious For some it 
isn't If it's a spouse it's a whole different set   of rules So this is for Yeah there's no rules for 
spouses Yeah I mean if you're a spouse then then   the account turns into yours And there's some 
limited circumstances where you wouldn't want   to have that happen But the vast majority of 
the time you want it to be considered your own   And the second question we sometimes get is "Oo 
I don't have an IRA of my own Can I just add to   this one versus opening?" Nope This is going to 
be a different game that you're playing So you   cannot add to an inherited IRA Yep Great question 
Lori Thank you so much for hanging out with us   and also for the voicemail Yep Yeah great job 
on the voicemail Great job He's a great job Go   talk to your mom Who's who's the comedian we love 
that does that Uh the Midwest comedian Uh Charlie   Barren So good He is hilarious I love that guy 
So so so good about the Midwest Nice No Hey I   mowed your lawn Hey I reshigled your house Hey 
I took your wife off to dinner What Wait what   be helping each other Next up we have Kevin Kevin 
heard our episode where we talking about the uh at   the time downturn in the market with the tariffs 
and some of the companies and how they responded   We uh profiled a piece that came from investment 
news which detailed how Edward Jones had responded   to the downturn in the stock market with some 
guaranteed products where we thought that maybe   they guaranteed that you'd cap your upside and 
really some some sketchy stuff Well Kevin wanted   to comment on that I was listening to your episode 
from I believe May 14th Uh I actually worked for   Edward Jones I'm not in the exact team or anything 
like that but I think you guys could do a little   more research on the article you guys had Um 
those alternative investments are only available   to a very few specific clients There's nothing 
Edward Jones has done to abandon our long-term   investment strategy especially regarding the stock 
market Um but think you guys should know that   uh there's definitely more to it than that Do 
a little more research figure out what details   you're actually putting out there before you know 
going through and saying things like what we did   on the 14th More than happy to talk further about 
it Let me know Thank you Kevin Thanks for hanging   out with us and thanks for for the message Our 
headline segment is what comes out from the news   and from your PR department I'll say this while 
I I love you calling us and calling into us and   telling us that you know maybe that all wasn't 
right We're not the Edward Jones PR department   We're not the people that put this out into the 
media stream Our job is to look at the things   that are reported on and go do we agree with this 
or not This was a piece that was reported on by   very responsible people and uh your PR department 
talked about it So I think instead of calling me   I think the better people to call would be your 
PR department and say "Listen you're screwing   me over with all these people and and you're 
making us look bad." That is not my job My job   is responsibility to make sure that I'm finding 
responsible sources which I did and to make sure   that we give a take about how this might be bad 
which we did I love the enthusiasm I love the fact   that you didn't like that headline I wouldn't like 
it either if somebody was talking about my company   and I knew there was more to the story But listen 
Edward Jones has a massive PR department I know   that because I used to work in the PR department 
for American Express They are massive And the   fact that if this was wrong that it got out into 
responsible media that your exec team was letting   crappy products like this go but it wasn't the 
full story I don't think that's on me That is not   on me That is definitely I'm with the Edward Jones 
PR team And really OG that is frustrating You know   when you work for a company and then you see a 
headline about your company I mean how many you   know back in the day when we worked with American 
Express you'd see a headline about that or about a   prize or about any of the companies that we worked 
for and you go "Oh man There the story is so much   deeper than this." I think when you look at the 
space of investment products the whole idea for   different types of products always starts at the 
higher level I mean we're seeing this with the   401k article we had two weeks ago right where it 
was like hey you get to do leverage in your 401k   or you get to buy private equity in your 401k 
from earlier this quarter You know when we talk   about that that didn't start at the mainstream 
investor level right That started with oh no no   that's just for that's just for the people that 
have 10 million That's just for them and then it   just trickles down right It's it's no different 
than what happens in the NBA All of a sudden the   college players do and then the college players do 
it and the high school players do it You know what   I mean While I appreciate Kevin's perspective 
of like hey this was this is an isolated thing   or this is really only for the it's yeah it 
probably was And to your point Joe you know hey   if they didn't want people to know about it they 
shouldn't have they shouldn't have released it in   the news but these types of products and it's 
maybe not a slight at Jones although you know   we think it's really silly that they have this 
stuff Well I think it's silly that any company   has it frankly So it's not them it's everybody 
But you're right it doesn't affect the mom and   pop customer that you have right now Right now 
it doesn't but it's coming And to your point Joe   I think it is our responsibility to say "Hey this 
is a product that's out there Yeah it only affects   people that have 10 million bucks right now but 
pay attention because this is coming your way." We   like Vanguard We like Fidelity We've talked about 
crazy stuff I'm in love with them We talked about   crazy stuff that they've done That is our role in 
the machine We don't like them more than a friend And Kevin by the way if if as an industry insider 
I mean if you've got a greater take on any of this   stuff and want to give our stackers some insight 
to it certainly call back Yeah I mean don't stop   calling back But I do want to draw a line between 
what is my job and what's your PR My job is not   that we're Jones PR department I just want to be 
very clear I'm not Fidelity's PR department I'm   not Vanguard's PR department Not even involved 
in American Express's PR department anymore If   it appears in responsible media and your CEO 
comments in the piece then that's fair game   for the Stacking Benjamin show frankly and I think 
for anybody else Uh but love it And to be clear we   we don't just think EJ is screwing the pooch here 
We'll also take shots at LPL and Charles Schwab   and Fidelity and Vanguard and all these people 
who do But good on him for calling us you know   calling us out on it and uh standing up for his 
own firm I love having this discussion too about   how the sausage gets made All right in the second 
half we've got questions from Michelle Michelle   earlier had written us about what advice do we 
have for single people She wanted to put that in a   voicemail We get a great question from her We get 
a fantastic question again about emergency funds   and what kind of distinguishing between high yield 
savings accounts and some other choices for that   We'll get OG's professional take on that And then 
a comment from Ron who we've been talking a lot   about lately about the student loan crisis and Ron 
has a take that he'd like to share as well That's   coming up in the second half of this amazing 
poperri episode But Doug speaking of amazing it's   an kind of an amazingly sad day upstairs because 
mom's got all the curtains drawn She is not in   a great mood It's dark You're right Hey there 
stackers I'm Joe's mom's neighbor Doug and it is   a tough day in the basement Joe's mom is like Joe 
said candles all over the house and the curtains   are drawn because today is the anniversary of 
Michael Jackson's death back on June 25th 2009   Jackson was of course one of the top artists of 
all time and it would take us hours to list all   of his accomplishment but here's here's two Uh 
he was a Grammy-winning artist like multiple He   probably won like a hundred Grammys I think 
And his thriller album sold an incredible 38   million copies in 1984 alone and it's still 
the bestselling solo album of all time That's   incredible All these years later it really is 
Here's today's question While a song he performed   with Paul McCartney called Say Say is listed by 
Billboard as Jackson's number one song ever which   Jackson solo hit did they rank as number two 
Or in other words his best hit as a solo artist   I'll be back right after I go tell those kids on 
the corner to beat it I mean just beat it kids [Music] Hey there stackers time backward walker and guy 
who loves Pepsi but you know not enough to get   burned by it Joe's mom's neighbor Doug Jackson's 
death truly was a tragedy and his doctor served   two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter 
But even with a life cut short Jackson still   reigns supreme as the king of pop music So 
which solo song does Billboard call his best   That would be a little diddy that spent 24 weeks 
on the Billboard chart and seven of those at   number one It was none other than Billy Jean And 
now back to two guys who aren't my lovers I think   everybody figured that one out They're just some 
dudes I know aren't the one Joe and OG [Music] but   the kid is not mine Oh Oh man Billy Jean there's a 
uh the Civil Wars You know the band Doug The Civil   Wars I don't They're a country folky band They 
do this wild sound Yeah And they do this wild uh   remake of Billy Jean in that kind of country 
folk Uh you know what I don't know if that's   just kind of the in thing to do in that genre but 
I've been getting a lot of that pop up either in   my like the made for me playlists or in my reels 
I've been seeing a bunch of covers by people with   floral dresses and banjos and kind of that whole 
Americana country theme So I I mean race your own   material There's a banjo band that's known for 
covers and they've done a seven nation army but   they have one album that is completely it's all 
AC/DC covers And it's so funny with the banjo She   was a fast machine She kept her motor clean She 
was the best damn woman It's so fun It's so fun   How does it go But how does it go again Yeah Yeah 
Keep going Joe Ruined your reputation all in one   fell swoop by singing You don't have a musical 
reputation Joe I'm not sure you've got much to   ruin I probably I might as well go ahead just 
burn whatever foundation I have to the ground   Yes Instead of doing that let's hear Michelle 
Please Michelle save this Hey Joe OG and Doug   This is Michelle You recently read my email on 
the back porch with a couple topic suggestions   In an effort to appease Doug and his concern about 
the state of my wardrobe I'm calling about one of   the topics I mentioned So here's the question Is 
there anything different a single person should   consider in financial planning A little about me 
I'm in my mid-30s currently single with no kids   I have an awesome but sometimes expensive dog I 
also have an amazing nephew and a niece on the way   My 401k is valued around 270,000 and about 30% 
are Roth contributions I max out my HSA each   year and it is valued around 10,000 My only debt 
is my mortgage though most likely I will need to   replace my car in the next 1 to 3 years Right 
now I'm focused on increasing my cash reserve   for a future car down payment home improvement 
projects and 6 to 12 months of living expenses   My parents recently retired from their corporate 
jobs and their investments are expected to cover   all their needs Most likely I will be the one 
to provide any future care needs my parents   have and I currently live one and a half hours 
from them I also have longevity on both sides   of my family Any advice is greatly appreciated 
Thanks Hey Michelle is that enough details for   you OG Holy cow she's That's fantastic I think 
I love that I mean now we can kind of dig into   the financial plan like that is fantastic stuff 
Michelle thanks so much for calling and uh what   a great topic OG I have a few things but not much 
because she's single but there's a lot going on   here A couple of things that I thought about were 
around protection planning And it's interesting   that she said that she would be expected to 
provide assistance like healthcare assistance   to her folks if they have enough money And I would 
wonder why I mean notwithstanding the fact that   maybe you want to do that or maybe that's your 
current profession you know you're a nurse or   whatever and you have that expertise but if they 
have enough money like why would you want to have   to do that I think that sounds more glamorous 
than it actually ends up becoming But what do   you mean by glamorous Like she's worried about it 
but it's not going to be a big deal No the other   way around I think I think you look at it and go 
"Oh no I would love to help mom if she was sick   and I could take care of her." Until you realize 
like that could be a 12-year process of 247 care   Yeah that's not as good as you think Would be 
tougher Yeah So I would I would rethink that with   your folks honestly But that also kind of dubtales 
into how you think about it for yourself because   if that's the expectation that your parents have 
for you who is the person that's going to do that   for you then assuming that you have the same 
life expectancy and the same she said she has   an awesome dog Yeah I I think that's one major 
thing to consider in terms of protection planning   is further health care costs and or responsibility 
of healthcare things down the line That's down the   line right Long-term care stuff is like 60 
plus That's when you think about that Maybe   55 A more immediate thing would be disability 
You know if you're sick or hurt and you can't   work for an extended period of time you know have 
another person that can pick up the slack or work   extra shifts or you know whatever That would be a 
major piece that I would look at from a planning   standpoint as well And then further down the line 
from a planning standpoint the only difference is   is you just have to think about how do you want 
to handle your estate given that the like normal   quote unquote normal way of doing it of everything 
goes to my spouse and if not my spouse my kids   And if not my kids then my grandkids You know so 
there's going to be some different dynamics there   of I've got some nieces and I've got some nephews 
and some of them I like and some of them I don't   you know this one's done well with their life and 
is responsible and this one hasn't And you know   what I mean You have a little different dynamic 
there I suspect But again that's you know you're   30 now that's like age 70 stuff right But in the 
meantime you can just make sure the beneficiaries   are right on your accounts and probably now you 
list mom and dad or maybe you know brothers or   sisters or something like that if mom and dad 
are good to go But from a planning perspective   I don't really see a profound difference With two 
people in the family you don't spend twice as much   So it's not like you get a half off discount on 
retirement It's you know there's something there   but yeah you still have to save money You still 
have to invest You still have to live within   your means manage your debt appropriately and 
that sort of thing U maybe not as much margin   of safety if there's not two incomes but I've 
seen plenty of two income families go sideways   just as quick as a single So that's Well that's 
the thing is being single you are the back stop   I mean there isn't somebody else that you can go 
well they might be the back stop they might not be   the back stop You are the back stop Yeah So I love 
that you led with disability for today long-term   care considerations for later The idea that your 
estate plan once again much later as well but also   I think the only thing I'd add on the short term 
is you know you got to get the raise The income   stream is going to come from you It's not going 
to come from anybody else So just advocating for   yourself and learning how to get the raise making 
sure that you're able to do that is going to be   important over the you know course of your 40s 
and 50s But I love how well she's set herself up   I mean mid30s and 270,000 in the 401k Oh gee while 
you were talking I was doing that rule of 72 the   mathematical magical number where if you take the 
interest rate you think you're going to get divide   it into 72 it tells you how many years it takes it 
to double So let's say she's at mid-30s Let's say   she's 35 then uh she gets 9% over a long period of 
time Definitely a can do number every eight years   That means her money is going to double when she's 
43 when she's 51 and when she's 59 if she looks   at retiring let's say at age 60 So at 270,000 she 
saved already with those three doublings The first   double sends it to $540,000 Second to a,80,000 
and then the third one 2.1 almost $2.2 million   She's already saved without having to save another 
dime So this phrase you know I hate all the cute   phrases but this quote coastfi also becomes a cool 
thing And that's not you know that has nothing to   do with your question about being single but also 
you know choosing your adventure Michelle What do   you want to do Because you've done a great job of 
setting yourself up with that And I love the money   in the HSA as well Yeah And the single piece of 
this is like you said you're your own backs stop   here So you have to advocate for yourself You also 
have to take a little bit more measured risks than   you know if there's two incomes where one person 
goes I think I want to go start this thing and I   think it might work but I don't know And but by 
giving yourself the head start by having a bunch   of money saved already you know maybe you're able 
to do that You know maybe you're able to try the   thing in your 50s because you've saved so much 
money and giving yourself enough So you've got to   build all that flexibility in yourself basically 
is what I'm saying Well and one thing that gives   her room to do OG she mentioned she didn't tell 
us how much she owes on the mortgage but you know   we've talked about how the happiest retirees they 
know the math but they pay off the mortgage early   And maybe Michelle if you get far enough ahead 
that you know you're going to be okay for   retirement maybe you can look at paying off that 
loan earlier which buys you even more flexibility   because if you have to be your own backs stop you 
want the commitments every month to be as low as   possible Yeah I started using Monarch this year 
mostly just to have a couple months of data just   to see and then and then it seemed like every 
month there was like well there's just this one   thing you know I was just this one thing this 
month just this one thing this month But it is   pretty profound I I did get a little analytical 
with it in this year to see how much we spend   in interest just you know interest on a couple 
houses and you know if you carry a credit card   balance or a car loan or whatever it is you know 
it's like you see that stuff pile up and then you   start looking at that going how much money do I 
have to make just to pay the freaking interest   You're saying it doesn't doesn't make sense to 
pay off your mortgage I look at that completely   differently I knew it in my soul before I saw the 
data But now I look at it and I go I have to make   thousands of dollars every single month just to 
pay the interest to the bank to have this house   Like the faster that like it just decreases the 
overall stress right I don't have it's like oh   I don't have to make this money I don't have 
this responsibility So I'm a big advocate for   paying the house off at a measured clip For sure 
Michelle great to hear your voice uh after the   fantastic letter a few months ago Congratulations 
on a nice job so far saving and really doing some   nice proactive stuff on your financial plan Next 
up we've got Ron who you know we've been talking   about the student loan crisis a bit and talking 
about heck on Monday's show we talked about more   people going into the trades and going maybe not 
college and also talking about how college costs   just keep going up and up and up and up Ron 
had some thoughts on the student loan crisis   Hi my name is Ron and I enjoy listening to the 
Stacking Benjamin's podcast Recently you mentioned   a student loan crisis where the millions of people 
are uh behind uh in their student loan payments   to the government The solution seems to be what 
we allow every other person who's in financial   trouble to do It's called bankruptcy Whether it's 
a uh poor decisions with their credit card poor   decisions in uh embarking on a small business 
or wrong decisions in a uh major corporation   we allow them to go bankrupt 7 years they're 
free and clear Yeah they have some limitations   and so on but in today's world that seems to be 
rather minimal But student loan debt you people   said it yourselves You interested in basically 
garnishing their social security I believe was   one of your statements Let's have them allow 
them to do bankruptcy just like every other   person who made a financial mistake and not put 
them in debtor's prison Again I enjoy listening   to your show but I was a comment that had to 
be made Thank you Ron Fantastic And you can   hear he's a little passionate about this topic I 
just want to correct one thing Ron We didn't say   you should garnish people social security Yeah 
Yeah That's what happens I was Yeah I I used the   word garnish OG talked about how it's going to 
come out of your social security You'll find you   don't have as much at the end of the party Yeah 
As you thought And I said kind of like garnishing   your wages But the two don't really go together 
It's not the same We did not round present that   as a solution Just FYI One solution we talked 
about is if people decided not to go to college   and there wasn't so much societal pressure to go 
to college then colleges through the law supply   and demand will not have a free lunch And if we 
stopped guaranteeing these loans knowing that   colleges can just charge more and more and more 
and the government will guarantee it heck that   gives them cart blanch I mean they can go ahead 
and raise prices We propose those two things more   people in trades which we need anyway And 
number two uh the fact that the guarantee   program we might need to rethink but but this 
idea of bankruptcy OG I mean he's he's not wrong   People go bankrupt and because they messed up with 
their credit cards Yeah I honestly haven't given   much thought to how to solve this problem both in 
the short run of the trillion dollars that people   owe presently and and over the long run of how do 
we fix it moving forward I can see the pros and   cons to both sides of it which are eventually this 
just gets passed on to taxpayers if you do allow a   big bankruptcy type thing Although frankly is that 
how you want to start your adult life Is you know   I don't know I I don't I don't have a good answer 
for it But I do recognize that this is a a major   problem And I would actually add one more to what 
you were saying Joe around solutions for this And   maybe it just kind of dovetales into what you were 
talking about around uh the societal pressures I   don't understand why there's so much negativity 
toward doing the community college or the the   pre-ol classes in high school where they're part 
of your normal curriculum It really kind of is   a very one side or the other type of either 
you're really pro that or you're really anti   that And it's funny because in just talking with 
people around this because you know it's what's   in our life right now The things that I hear from 
parents just kind of anecdotally the things that   they say is really interesting They'll say like 
"Well you know I really wanted Johnny to get the   full college experience." And going to community 
college you just wouldn't get that And I'm like   "What what part of college experience are you You 
miss the drunk frat parties Is that part of the   And honestly I think there are some parents that 
think that that's a right of passage you know like   no no no you haven't lived until you've thrown up 
in somebody else's shoes before you know and it's   like I'm okay with my kid not experiencing that 
ever in his life We make that joke It's easy for   a lot of people make that same joke What about you 
know being hung over and and all of that That's an   easy joke But I think honestly a huge benefit for 
both of my guys going away to college wasn't that   part Of course it was the living alone and having 
to manage your daily life living alone versus   staying with your parents and and doing community 
college So I think you can get that experience and   still go to community college Just get your butt 
out of the house get a job go to community college   and get an apartment Yeah Or what's the problem 
with that experience happening at 20 instead of   18 I mean there's there's countries that have 
mandatory military service right You got to do   a certain amount of military service time between 
high school and advanced school college whatever   I'm not saying that that's a solution I'm just 
saying like there's lots of ways to grow up We   have for some reason decided that 18 is the grow 
up age It's like well you're 18 You got to grow   up It's like well we're almost 10 years early 
Have you Yeah Have you been around 18 year olds   Cuz they're not even starting No offense to my son 
but he's he just he was like I don't know how to   reschedule my apple my Genius Bar appointment for 
Thursday Can you Oh my god One thing at a time Dad   One thing at a time And so you know I'm happy 
to help them with it but we have adopted this   as the thing right And there are some people who 
say like "Oh no I don't want to have I don't want   to put that pressure on my kid to like have to do 
all those college level courses in high school."   Okay fair enough Just like there's people on 
the one side that go "Why wouldn't I have my   kid do all this college level work in high school 
It's free." Like my taxes are paying for this Why   wouldn't I have if they're able and confident and 
smart enough to do that at that time It's like for   some reason there's this like you said Joe there's 
this societal weird thing that happens like well I   can't because Johnny needs to go away to grow up 
or even like you said when we were talking about   this before about college OG I think on one of 
last week's shows we were talking about you know   even your son going well yeah he's not going 
to college like you know what I mean the kind   of whisper campaign against kids that don't go to 
college like there's something less when I was in   high I mean this isn't new by the way when I went 
to high school and I joined the Marine Corps for   I'd signed on the line in February So I was still 
in high school you know I was you know you signed   up early basically like I'll leave on this day 
and I was in the school play I was in the school   musical that year that spring and I had to go do 
like a physical test you know and some other stuff   at the training center Anyways uh so I told the 
play director I said "Hey I can't go to practice   today I got to do this thing down in Lancing." 
And he said "What college thing?" I said "Well   actually I joined the Marine Corps so I've got 
to do this thing." And he said "You did what?" Hm   You know and I said "Well anyways I gotta do this 
thing." The next day I didn't go to a class Every   time I sat in a class the teacher would go "Uh you 
need to go see Mr Smith right now in his office."   And I did like this rotating like it was like it 
went around at that school joining the military   was like "No no no no no We don't do that here 
You go to college from this school." Yeah I mean   look at one of the key stats that people look at 
when they look for what school districts they want   to move into and it's the percent of high school 
graduates that go that go to college They go to   college It's a major metric It It certainly is You 
screwed your whole town over OG I'm just saying   30 years ago 30 years ago this was still a thing 
Yeah And it was it a little different but still   So I don't know There's no right answers here And 
Ron obviously we're not going to solve this on the   Stacking Benjamin show in a 10 minutes It' be cool 
if we did right We just solved it Solved it And   we'll just keep talking I bet you we stumble on 
something We probably figured out and then a whole   nation will unify behind it and everybody will 
get on track and agree on the same thing that we   decided here on the show Yeah Generally on Stacky 
Benjamins of course we're about these are the   rules What do you do about it And certainly one 
thing you can do is declare bankruptcy So there   it is Let's finish this off with VJ who is uh only 
last because he was of all the questions we took   today the last one to ask a question alphabet So 
if we can get to yours it'll be both ways I guess   Yeah VJ you're if if you would have been first in 
line I love OG when you were talking about your   son uh that you guys were what uh third in line at 
graduation Yeah third in line at graduation Then   Doug he had to sit through that entire boring 
kid by kid after his kid And then you feel bad   because you're like clapping and then you're like 
I'm done clapping And then the people behind us   had their kid They're like woo And I'm like yay 
You know cuz I didn't want to be not clapping   for their kid but they were back up Proximity 
bias There is definitely an upside to being an   S I suppose there So uh but anyway VJ uh thanks 
for the question Let's hear which on your mind   Hey Joe OG and neighbor Doug I've got a question 
about emergency funds Is there a reason not to   keep your emergency fund in an ETF like SGV 
instead of a high yield savings account I   understand that like instant access might be one 
concern but beyond that is there anything else I   should be thinking about The yield difference 
might not be huge for small balances but if   someone's keeping a year's worth of expenses in 
there that could add up to a few hundred bucks Uh   so curious to hear your thoughts Thanks and see 
you Thank you That's hilarious with the classic   Doug sign off too Badass call OG uh esc for people 
that don't know this the share zero to threemonth   treasury bond This thing has barely a live 
person's heartbeat when it comes to volatility   So what do you think about heading that way with 
your emergency fund Yeah I mean if you look at the   underlying investments then you would sign off on 
that as a cash holding right Because it's zero to   threemonth US treasuries That's totally acceptable 
from a savings standpoint The only issue is the   liquidity like he brought up meaning it's going to 
take you a couple of days to get the money which   honestly if you're thinking about this like a tier 
you probably want in in his example he said a year   of cash reserve So maybe you've got one or two 
months worth of expenses in your checking account   Maybe you've got a month of expenses in your 
savings account and that just kind of keeps   the float going of paycheck going in and bills 
going out at a asynchronous time And then maybe   in his case he's got nine months of emergency fund 
money Yeah that totally is fine in in a a Treasury   ETF or a actual Treasury bill or bond itself like 
whatever floats your boat or a savings account And   you're right it's not that big of a difference 
I I think you can find good savings accounts   right now in the 4% range SGOV probably paying 
a little bit more than 4 and a.5% would be my   guess in terms of dividends So you're picking 
up a half a percent and just like you said if   that's 100 grand you know that's $500 a year The 
question of course is is all of that juice worth   the squeeze So if you're talking about a bunch 
of money and it's five six00 bucks a year I can   see why it would make sense If your emergency fund 
is three months and you're going well I've got 10   grand in this account Is it worth it Probably not 
You know I like to have the simplicity of keeping   everything where it's supposed to be And what I 
mean by that is you're going to have bigger issues   trying to move money from one place to another 
to cover stuff in your emergency fund Like let's   say for example you're trying to overoptimize 
everything and and you say "Well I don't need   a month's worth of money in my checking account 
I need a week's worth of money in my checking   account And then I'm going to take money from my 
savings account I'm going to put it in my checking   account when I get paid you know and I'm going to 
do all this stuff right so that I can make it all   exactly optimized so I have the most money in my 
savings account or most money in SOV and then you   miss one Friday of doing it because you're sick 
or you're traveling and on Monday you get hit   with two $35 overdraft charges because you didn't 
get the money in fast enough even though you've   got it like what what did you gain from that 
Also how much is your time worth than having   to manage your cash flow on a day-to-day basis 
I would much rather have two months worth of   money in my checking account a month in my savings 
account link those two together and then check the   balances on the 30th of every month You know what 
I mean Like batch that transaction or batch that   time into one thing So if he's talking about a a 
year of cash reserve or a two-year cash reserve   where he's really super funded his his emergency 
fund and he's like "Oh yeah I'm you know I would   need to I would know that there's a problem weeks 
in advance that I would need this money and so   I'm okay with the fact this could take a couple 
days and that sort of thing." Absolutely Have fun   get after it There are some people that might 
wonder why you would have that much money in   emergency fund I can think of three reasons Number 
one if the career you're in is very volatile and   it's going to be difficult to find another job and 
you're living off a decent amount of that money a   decent percentage that's number one Number two is 
Paula Pant has talked about the fact that she's   got two different emergency funds She's got one 
for her but also her real estate business And if   she has vacancies over a number of months then she 
needs to keep some money also there So that can   also equal maybe a year or more Well and remember 
also that your spending and my spending are   different numbers And so when when you say like 
your cash reserves is $100,000 and some people   go like "Oh my god that's so much money." And some 
people like that's three weeks That's like a month   and a half You know I'm a little underfunded right 
now It's a little light So it's not the absolute   dollars I think is what you're saying you know 
also well and then there's the third one which   of course is if you are financially independent 
you're living off of your assets You've always   advocated keep a couple years in cash so that 
you've got you should have if you're getting   close to retirement or retired you should have 
two years worth of your portfolio distribution   sitting in cash and SGOV is a great place for that 
or money market fund You know again all of those   are fairly similar You know you're not going 
to pick up or lose anything in any one of them   One thing to look out for when I was looking at 
this on Morning Star is that while SGV hasn't lost   money the index that they compare it to has lost 
money before So you can have loss of principle So   if losing principle from time to it ain't going to 
happen often but if losing principle is the deal   breaker for you you don't want SGOV Thank you so
