And so I now stack my\\njournal writing habit with my coffee habit. I will never forget to\\ndrink coffee in the morning. That's impossible. And so when I have\\nthat cup of coffee, that is now the cue or the\\ntrigger that tells me time to write in a journal.

So if you donate a hundred dollars to a not-for-profit to a charity, you will get $30 back in\\nthat situation on your taxes but you still donated a net $70.

The other issue is cars are\\ndriving around pretty fast and they can actually cause\\na lot of damage to property or to people. And so the first thing to think about of any type of insurance\\nis what's the premium? What do you pay for that insurance? And then what's the deductible? Remember, in other videos we\\ntalk about that deductible. If you have a $5,000 deductible tha\",\n",
       " \"t means you have to spend\\nthe first $5,000 yourself. People will often say that's out of pocket and then the insurance kicks in. Usually the higher the deductible for a given amount of coverage or depending on the different\\ndimensions of coverage, the lower the premium's going to be because the insurance company feels like, well, yeah it's gonna be less likely that we're going to have\\nto pay for something. But then above and beyond\\npremiums and deductibles there's a lot of different dimensions o\",\n",
       " \"f automobile insurance. The first dimension is that of liability. And liability really matters because a car might cost\\ntens of thousands of dollars but if heaven forbid you\\nwere to run into someone or cause damage to someone else, especially if they could\\nget really hurt or worse you could be liable for hundreds\\nof thousands of dollars. So it could be much more\\nexpensive than the car itself. And many states actually require you to actually have liability insurance, even if you aren't required, \",\n",
       " \"I highly recommend that you\\nhave liability insurance and no matter how carefully you drive and I do recommend you drive\\ncarefully, accidents do happen. People clearly get hurt on the road, and if someone were to sue you and you were to lose a lawsuit that would cost a lot of money. And even if you don't lose the lawsuit the legal expenses can be a lot. So having liability\\ninsurance can help out there. Now, beyond liability, obviously, what most people think of when\\nthey think of car insurance is\",\n",
       " ' your car gets into an accident, there is some damage involved, how do you repair that damage? So that is collision insurance and many car insurances, they\\'ll say, \"Okay, we\\'re gonna cover\\nliability for this much. We\\'re gonna cover collision for this much. And that\\'s pure if you get in an accident, you are covered for that.\" Now, sometimes there\\'s\\nanother little piece called uninsured insurance, or if someone is underinsured or uninsured and your car gets damaged, well then, and really they were',\n",

       " \"- Now let's talk about some of the words you're likely to hear if\\nyou're dealing with insurance. So the first one is a premium\\nor an insurance premium, and that's really just what you're paying in order to get the insurance. So if you pay, let's say $200\\na month for health insurance, that $200 a month is your premium. Now the other number or the other word you'll\\nhear a lot is deductible. Now this is an amount of money that you're going to have to pay and then only when you\\nget above that amount\",\n",
       " \", then the insurance kicks in. So let's say your health\\ninsurance has a $5,000 deductible, and let's say you have to\\ngo through some type of, and let's say it's the\\nbeginning of the year. Usually it's based on a calendar year, and you have to get some\\ntype of healthcare done, and it costs $2,000. Well, you're going to pay\\nthat $2,000 out of pocket. You're going to pay that yourself, because you haven't\\nhit the deductible yet. Let's say you have to\\ngo in that same year, do another thing that cost\",\n",
       " \"s $3,000. Once again, you're going\\nto pay that out of pocket, which is just another way of saying you're gonna pay that yourself. It's not gonna come through insurance, but so far you have paid $5,000, $2,000 for the first thing,\\n$3,000 for the second thing. And now if you were to go and let's say have to get a\\nanother $5,000 procedure done in that same year, now the insurance will kick in because you used up your deductible. So if there's a $5,000 deductible, and you'll see it on health insuran\",\n",
       " 'ce, you\\'ll see it on car insurance. You pay that first amount, and then the insurance kicks\\nin above and beyond that. Now you might say, \"Well, why would I ever\\nhave or want a deductible?\" Well, usually the higher the deductible, the lower your premium. You usually have to pay less for insurance that has a high deductible. From an insurance company\\'s point of view, they say, \"Okay, the deductible\\nis kind of an incentive for you to not necessarily\\nuse this service, you know, get your car\\nin a wre',\n",
       " 'ck all the time, or necessarily have to go\\nto healthcare all the time.\" And from your point of view, you might say, \"Hey, you know what? I really, I\\'m willing\\nto take a deductible, because at the end of the day, insurance is really for if the bills become really,\\nreally, really large.\" So just another example. Let\\'s say your car insurance\\nhas a $5,000 deductible. Well, I\\'ll use a different number. Let\\'s say your car insurance\\nhas a $1,000 deductible, and then you were to get into\\nsome type of a ',\n",

So you pay that $1,000 out of pocket, and then we are going to\\npay the remaining $2,000 for that total of $3,000 for the repair.',\n",
       " '\" Now, the last thing I\\'ll talk about is, there\\'s oftentimes some type of limit to the insurance policy, or sometimes they\\'ll\\ncall it a policy limit, and that\\'s this idea that the insurance might cover\\nyou up to a certain amount. So let\\'s say you have liability insurance. That\\'s really just insurance in case someone sues you\\nfor doing something wrong. Usually that has a limit to it, so it might have a $100,000 limit or $500,000, whatever it means. And what that means is,\\nlet\\'s say someone sues y',\n",

Well, then the insurance company\\nwill go up to the 100,000 and then you're gonna have to pay that other $25,000 out of pocket. One last word now that\\nI really think about, is the notion of a copay, and\",\n",
       " ' you\\'re gonna see a copay a lot when you\\'re thinking\\nabout health insurance, whether it\\'s health insurance\\nor dental insurance. And that\\'s this idea that let\\'s say you go for\\nyour regular checkups, either your dental checkups\\nor your healthcare checkups. You might see copays at other places. The actual cost of that\\ncheckup might be three or $400, and the insurance company\\nsays, \"You know what?

So for example, with my health insurance, I go, I get a checkup, I\\nhave to pay a $20 copay.

You\\'re like, \"Well, what\\'s\\nthe cost of a loan?\" Well, sometimes, there\\'s just an outright\\nfee associated with it, but more likely, or on top of that, the interest that you pay on\\na loan is how much you pay. So if you\\'re paying 2%\\ninterest for a loan, you\\'re paying a lot less\\nper dollar on that loan than if you had to pay,\\nsay, 20% or 30% interest.

If you've watched our\\nvideos on compound interest, if you're paying 20%\\ninterest or even 10% interest and if you're not paying down\\nthat balance pretty quickly, that could end up being\\na lot, a lot of money. You could very easily end up\\npaying a lot more in interest than the initial amount of money\\nthat you actually borrowed. Now, what are the scenarios?

There's loans where if you\\naren't able to pay it back, the person who lent you money, they're still gonna be\\nable to get something.
